Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous tasks within the computer vision field, including image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated considerable success in generating high-fidelity 3D models of talking portraits. Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.

Abstract: Head avatar reenactment focuses on creating animatable personal avatars from monocular videos, serving as a foundational element for applications like social signal understanding, gaming, human-machine interaction, and computer vision. Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Caribou across the Arctic has declined in recent decades, motivating scalable and accurate monitoring approaches to guide evidence-based conservation actions and policy decisions. Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions. Overall, pretraining on coarse labels prior to detection makes it possible to rely on weakly-supervised pretrained weights even when labeled data are limited, achieving results comparable to generic-weight initialization.

Abstract: As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution. This framework is generic, flexible, and training-free, making it well-suited for robust fake image detection across diverse and evolving settings.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for surgical scene understanding. However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is an extension of federated learning that places minimal requirements on the clients computing infrastructure, since only a small portion of the overall model is deployed on the clients hardware. In SplitFed learning, feature values, gradient updates, and model updates are transferred across communication channels. In this paper, we study the effects of noise in the communication channels on the learning process and the quality of the final model. We propose a smart averaging strategy for SplitFed learning with the goal of improving resilience against channel noise. Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) has advanced with generative modeling, enabling photorealistic image generation. In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.
  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.

Abstract: Camera redirection aims to replay a dynamic scene from a single monocular video under a user-specified camera trajectory. However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation. Project page and code will be released soon.

Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging requires uncertainty quantification that provides rigorous error guarantees while remaining anatomically meaningful. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $λ$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $α=0.1$.

Abstract: Chronic wound monitoring and management require accurate and efficient wound measurement methods. This paper presents a fast, non-invasive 3D wound measurement algorithm based on RGB-D imaging. The method combines RGB-D odometry with B-spline surface reconstruction to generate detailed 3D wound meshes, enabling automatic computation of clinically relevant wound measurements such as perimeter, surface area, and dimensions. We evaluated our system on realistic silicone wound phantoms and measured sub-millimetre 3D reconstruction accuracy compared with high-resolution ground-truth scans. The extracted measurements demonstrated low variability across repeated captures and strong agreement with manual assessments. The proposed pipeline also outperformed a state-of-the-art object-centric RGB-D reconstruction method while maintaining runtimes suitable for real-time clinical deployment. Our approach offers a promising tool for automated wound assessment in both clinical and remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: We introduce neural cortical maps, a continuous and compact neural representation for cortical feature maps, as an alternative to traditional discrete structures such as grids and meshes. It can learn from meshes of arbitrary size and provide learnt features at any resolution. Neural cortical maps enable efficient optimization on the sphere and achieve runtimes up to 30 times faster than classic barycentric interpolation (for the same number of iterations). As a proof of concept, we investigate rigid registration of cortical surfaces and propose NC-Reg, a novel iterative algorithm that involves the use of neural cortical feature maps, gradient descent optimization and a simulated annealing strategy. Through ablation studies and subject-to-template experiments, our method demonstrates sub-degree accuracy ($<1^\circ$ from the global optimum), and serves as a promising robust pre-alignment strategy, which is critical in clinical settings.

Abstract: World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).

Abstract: Traditional image registration methods are robust but slow due to their iterative nature. While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets. The source code will be publicly available following the acceptance of this work.

Abstract: With large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieving significant advancements in open-domain image creation, increasing attention has been focused on their natural extension to the realm of text-driven image-to-image (I2I) translation, where a source image acts as visual guidance to the generated image in addition to the textual guidance provided by the text prompt. We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.

Abstract: Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.

Abstract: Industrial point cloud segmentation for Digital Twin construction faces a persistent challenge: safety-critical components such as reducers and valves are systematically misclassified. These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.

Abstract: Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.

Abstract: Unlike conventional person re-identification (ReID), clothes-changing ReID (CC-ReID) presents severe challenges due to substantial appearance variations introduced by clothing changes. In this work, we propose the Quality-Aware Dual-Branch Matching (QA-ReID), which jointly leverages RGB-based features and parsing-based representations to model both global appearance and clothing-invariant structural cues. These heterogeneous features are adaptively fused through a multi-modal attention module. At the matching stage, we further design the Quality-Aware Query Adaptive Convolution (QAConv-QA), which incorporates pixel-level importance weighting and bidirectional consistency constraints to enhance robustness against clothing variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QA-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, and significantly outperforms existing approaches under cross-clothing scenarios.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of retinal arteries and veins carries the diagnosis of systemic cardiovascular conditions. However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects. Evaluation on the Fundus-AVSeg dataset reveals state-of-the-art performance, achieving a combined Dice score of 90.97% and a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.50 pixels. Notably, our method decreases vessel fragmentation by approximately 38% relative to baselines, yielding topologically coherent vascular trees viable for automated biomarker quantification. We open-source our code at https://tffm-module.github.io/.

Abstract: Low-light image super-resolution (LLSR) is a challenging task due to the coupled degradation of low resolution and poor illumination. To address this, we propose the Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network (GTFMN), a novel framework that decouples the LLSR task into two sub-problems: illumination estimation and texture restoration. First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution. Further, this map is utilized as an explicit guide within our novel Illumination Guided Modulation Block (IGM Block) to dynamically modulate features in the Texture Stream. This mechanism achieves spatially adaptive restoration, enabling the network to intensify enhancement in poorly lit regions while preserving details in well-exposed areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTFMN achieves the best performance among competing methods on the OmniNormal5 and OmniNormal15 datasets, outperforming them in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/

Abstract: While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting. The evaluation metrics and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VC-Bench-1B67/.

Abstract: While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising concerns about authenticity and trust in digital media. Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.

Abstract: Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics.

We present the Augmented Shadow Face in the Wild (ASFW) dataset, the first large-scale real-world dataset for facial shadow removal, containing 1,081 paired shadow and shadow-free images created via a professional Photoshop workflow. ASFW offers photorealistic shadow variations and accurate ground truths, bridging the gap between synthetic and real domains. Deep models trained on ASFW demonstrate improved shadow removal in real-world conditions. We also introduce the Face Shadow Eraser (FSE) method to showcase the effectiveness of the dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ASFW enhances the performance of facial shadow removal models, setting new standards for this task.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

Abstract: Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.

Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.

Abstract: Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD.

Abstract: Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

Abstract: Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.

Abstract: We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo

We benchmark representative VLMs on ScenePilot-Bench, providing empirical analyses that clarify current performance boundaries and identify gaps for driving-oriented reasoning. ScenePilot-Bench offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing VLMs in safety-critical autonomous driving contexts.

Abstract: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.

Abstract: Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

Abstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/KeepLoRA.

Abstract: In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for learning and function approximation, but they inherently yield outputs that are globally smooth. As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zywang0104/Video-KTR.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models have been extensively researched in various fields, which address the limitations of previous models by effectively managing long-range dependencies with a linear-time overhead. Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs. To achieve this goal, we develop double self-distillation methods to align the features at both the global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.

Abstract: Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.

Abstract: The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.

Abstract: 3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.

Abstract: Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

Abstract: Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.

Abstract: Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.

Abstract: Robust 3D hand reconstruction in egocentric vision is challenging due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex hand-object interactions. Prior methods mitigate these issues by scaling training data or adding auxiliary cues, but they often struggle in unseen contexts. We present EgoHandICL, the first in-context learning (ICL) framework for 3D hand reconstruction that improves semantic alignment, visual consistency, and robustness under challenging egocentric conditions. EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate real-world generalization and improve EgoVLM hand-object interaction reasoning by using reconstructed hands as visual prompts.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering. By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively. We demonstrate that these threshold states are characterized by a significant enhancement of the resonant cross-section, driven by the inverse relationship between the tunneling width and the spectral density peak.

Abstract: We analyze the subleading three-nucleon contact interaction terms at N4LO in chiral effective field theory. We perform the isospin projection into $T=1/2$ and $T=3/2$ states, and find that only eleven of the thirteen operators contribute in the $T=1/2$ channel. By projection on the partial waves of the asymptotic configuration of $N-d$ scattering states in momentum space, we find contributions from ten combinations of LECs. These results provide a useful basis for including N4LO three-body forces in few-body calculations and for constraining them through numerical fits to data.

Abstract: The breakdown of azimuthal two-particle correlation factorization, quantified by the ratios $r_2$ and $r_3$, serves as a sensitive probe of transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations. While hydrodynamic models predict $r_3 \leq 1$, experimental data from CMS in p-Pb collisions exhibit $r_3 > 1$, presenting a clear puzzle. We show that transverse momentum conservation (TMC) is the key mechanism dictating this factorization breakdown in small systems. We systematically calculate the effect of TMC as a function of the momentum difference between particles across various multiplicity and momentum ranges. Our results are in quantitative agreement with CMS p-Pb data for both $r_2$ and $r_3$. A central finding is a sign rule: under TMC, the deviation $r_n - 1$ follows $\left ( - 1 \right )^{n+1} $, being negative for even and positive for odd harmonic orders $n$. This work establishes an analytical framework to quantify transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations and provides new insights into the origin of collectivity in small colliding systems.

Abstract: Motivated by the necessity of developing theoretical models for studying the electroweak structure of baryons in a nuclear medium, we apply a covariant quark model to study interactions of baryons with nuclear matter. The electromagnetic and axial form factors of the octet baryons are determined by combining a covariant quark model that takes into account the meson cloud dressing of the baryon cores, developed for free space, with the quark-meson coupling model in the extension to the nuclear medium. We discuss the medium modifications on the electroweak form factors of octet baryons for the range of densities from $ρ=0$ up to $ρ=2 ρ_0$, where $ρ_0= 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$ is the normal nuclear matter density. We also study how the shape of the form factors is modified in finite nuclei due to the profile of the nuclear density distributions compared with calculations using the average density of the nucleus

Abstract: The short-distance production of multi-particle states in high-energy nuclear reactions provides a unique way to study the low-energy properties of few-body systems. In particular, the production amplitude of multi-neutron systems is strongly constrained by an approximate conformal symmetry of the underlying theory. We calculate the full amplitude for the short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length in leading order pionless EFT, focusing on the cases of three neutrons and three spinless bosons. We investigate the signature of low-energy resonances and other correlations in the relative energy distributions. For the case of neutrons, we compare to the predictions from approximate conformal symmetry close to the unitary limit and calculate the range corrections up to next-to-next-to leading order.

Abstract: We investigate the process in which Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) excites a baryon resonance. In particular, we assess, in DVCS leading to the Roper resonance, the relative importance of a "background'' process in which a pion is first emitted by the nucleon, which then undergoes a DVCS event. Our numerical results, using realistic DVCS kinematics, indicate that there can be measurable interference effects. They suggest that this process could substantially modify the experimentally observed cross sections at CLAS12-like kinematics, motivating their inclusion in precision analyses of DVCS experiments. We further find that in spite of this background, the transition to a Roper-like state through DVCS does contribute significantly to the $e^- N\to e^-γNπ$ cross section in some kinematic regions. This suggests that the creation of nucleon resonances via DVCS is a useful method for extracting information about the nucleon transition GPDs and the internal structure of the excited states.

Abstract: Employing the well-known unitary equivalence between Fokker-Planck operators and Schrödinger Hamiltonians, we compute the quasi-normal-mode spectrum of ultrarelativistic kinetic theories with momentum-space diffusion. We show that the collision operator reduces to a Dirac-delta Schrödinger problem in one spatial dimension, and to a Coulomb Schrödinger operator with hydrogenic spectrum in three dimensions. Finite spatial wavenumber appears as a perturbation of the associated quantum potential. The hydrodynamic mode is found to obey exact Fick-type diffusion at all real wavenumbers, whereas relativistic kinematics generically produces a continuous ballistic band in the non-hydrodynamic sector, a feature absent in the Newtonian regime.

Abstract: Radial oscillations provide a direct probe of the stability and compressibility of neutron stars and are highly sensitive to the equation of state of dense matter. In this work, we investigate the impact of antikaon condensates on the radial oscillation properties of neutron stars. For this purpose, we model neutron star matter using equations of state with a wide range of stiffness. Both non--linear and density--dependent relativistic mean--field frameworks are employed to develop equations of state that are consistent with current astrophysical constraints. We further consider the emergence of antikaon condensates ($K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$) in the stellar core, which modifies the pressure--energy density relation of dense matter. We find that the nature of the transition from nuclear matter to the condensed phase is sensitive to the antikaon optical potential depth. We compute the fundamental and higher--order radial oscillation modes for neutron stars containing antikaon condensates over a range of antikaon optical potential depths. Our results demonstrate that the antikaon optical potential depth plays a decisive role in governing the systematic shifts observed in the radial oscillation frequencies, while also significantly reducing the stability limits and maximum masses of neutron stars. These imprints of antikaon condensation on radial oscillation spectra provide a promising avenue for future multi--messenger observations and high--frequency gravitational--wave searches to directly probe and constrain the internal composition and equation of state of neutron stars.

Abstract: Particle correlations and femtoscopy are a rich subfield of high-energy physics. As the experimental data become more precise, there is an increasing need for the theoretical calculations to provide better and more general descriptions of the measurements. One of the important new directions is the investigation of the precise shape of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions utilizing Lévy-stable distributions. This work is a direct follow-up to our previous study, in which we developed a novel method for calculating Bose-Einstein correlation functions including the Coulomb final-state interaction. In this paper, we present a self-consistent generalization of the previous approach to non-spherical source functions and investigate the validity of the previously applied approximations assuming spherical symmetry. We present a software package that includes the calculation of a fully three-dimensional correlation function including the Coulomb interaction.

Abstract: We present a unified description of dense matter and neutron-star structure based on simple but physically motivated models. Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $β$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars.

Abstract: A unified analysis based on the cranking model is presented, demonstrating that both the Bohr and Variable Moment of Inertia (VMI) models arise as limiting cases of this framework. This result resolves the apparent contradiction between the two models by showing that they correspond to different physical limits of the same formalism. In addition, this analysis explicitly reveals the contribution of Coriolis effects to the rotational energy and moment of inertia.

Abstract: Presumably, peer reviewers and Large Language Models (LLMs) do very different things when asked to assess research. Still, recent evidence has shown that LLMs have a moderate ability to predict quality scores of published academic journal articles. One untested potential application of LLMs is for internal departmental review, which may be used to support appointment and promotion decisions or to select outputs for national assessments. This study assesses for the first time the extent to which (1) LLM quality scores align with internal departmental quality ratings and (2) LLM reports differ from expert reports. Using a private dataset of 58 published journal articles from the School of Information at the University of Sheffield, together with internal departmental quality ratings and reports, ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4o mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash scores correlate positively and moderately with internal departmental ratings, whether the input is just title/abstract or the full text. Whilst departmental reviews tended to be more specific and showing field-level knowledge, ChatGPT reports tended to be standardised, more general, repetitive, and with unsolicited suggestions for improvement. The results therefore (a) confirm the ability of LLMs to guess the quality scores of published academic research moderately well, (b) confirm that this ability is a guess rather than an evaluation (because it can be made based on title/abstract alone), (c) extend this ability to internal departmental expert review, and (d) show that LLM reports are less insightful than human expert reports for published academic journal articles.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are rapidly being adopted across diverse domains. Since they interact with users without supervision, they must be tested extensively. Current testing approaches focus on acceptance-level evaluation from the user's perspective. While intuitive, these tests require manual evaluation, are difficult to automate, do not facilitate root cause analysis, and incur expensive test environments. In this paper, we present methods to enable structural testing of LLM-based agents. Our approach utilizes traces (based on OpenTelemetry) to capture agent trajectories, employs mocking to enforce reproducible LLM behavior, and adds assertions to automate test verification. This enables testing agent components and interactions at a deeper technical level within automated workflows. We demonstrate how structural testing enables the adaptation of software engineering best practices to agents, including the test automation pyramid, regression testing, test-driven development, and multi-language testing. In representative case studies, we demonstrate automated execution and faster root-cause analysis. Collectively, these methods reduce testing costs and improve agent quality through higher coverage, reusability, and earlier defect detection. We provide an open source reference implementation on GitHub.

Abstract: Static analysis tools (SATs) are widely adopted in both academia and industry for improving software quality, yet their practical use is often hindered by high false positive rates, especially in large-scale enterprise systems. These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review. Finally, our case analysis further identifies key limitations of LLM-based false alarm reduction in industrial settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to automate real-world vulnerability detection due to two key limitations: the heterogeneity of vulnerability patterns undermines the effectiveness of a single unified model, and manual prompt engineering for massive weakness categories is unscalable.
  To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MulVul}, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for precise and broad-coverage vulnerability detection. MulVul adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy: a \emph{Router} agent first predicts the top-$k$ coarse categories and then forwards the input to specialized \emph{Detector} agents, which identify the exact vulnerability types. Both agents are equipped with retrieval tools to actively source evidence from vulnerability knowledge bases to mitigate hallucinations.
  Crucially, to automate the generation of specialized prompts, we design \emph{Cross-Model Prompt Evolution}, a prompt optimization mechanism where a generator LLM iteratively refines candidate prompts while a distinct executor LLM validates their effectiveness. This decoupling mitigates the self-correction bias inherent in single-model optimization.
  Evaluated on 130 CWE types, MulVul achieves 34.79\% Macro-F1, outperforming the best baseline by 41.5\%. Ablation studies validate cross-model prompt evolution, which boosts performance by 51.6\% over manual prompts by effectively handling diverse vulnerability patterns.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have shown remarkable performance in vision and language tasks but pose unique challenges for safety-critical applications. This paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating Transformers into automotive systems from a safety perspective. We outline how multimodal Foundation Models can leverage sensor diversity and redundancy to improve fault tolerance and robustness. Our proposed architecture combines multiple independent modality-specific encoders that fuse their representations into a shared latent space, supporting fail-operational behavior if one modality degrades. We demonstrate how different input modalities could be fused in order to maintain consistent scene understanding. By structurally embedding redundancy and diversity at the representational level, this approach bridges the gap between modern deep learning and established functional safety practices, paving the way for certifiable AI systems in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet they often introduce subtle logic or data-misuse errors that differ from human bugs. To study how these two error types interact, we construct Tricky$^2$, a hybrid dataset that augments the existing TrickyBugs corpus of human-written defects with errors injected by both GPT-5 and OpenAI-oss-20b across C++, Python, and Java programs. Our approach uses a taxonomy-guided prompting framework to generate machine-originated bugs while preserving original human defects and program structure. The resulting corpus spans human-only, LLM-only, and human+LLM splits, enabling analysis of mixed-origin error behavior, multi-bug repair robustness, and reliability in hybrid human-machine code. This paper outlines the dataset construction pipeline and illustrates its use through small-scale baseline evaluations of classification, localization, and repair tasks.

Abstract: Python libraries often need to maintain a stable public API even as internal implementations evolve, gain new backends, or depend on heavy optional libraries. In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on "reachable internals" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries.

Abstract: Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs) have been used in many agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) systems, primarily for validating promising fixes and aiding fix generation. In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code review automation, such as review comment generation, yet they suffer from hallucinations -- where the generated review comments are ungrounded in the actual code -- poses a significant challenge to the adoption of LLMs in code review workflows. To address this, we explore effective and scalable methods for a hallucination detection in LLM-generated code review comments without the reference. In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production. Our results suggest that HalluJudge can serve as a practical safeguard to reduce developers' exposure to hallucinated comments, fostering trust in AI-assisted code reviews.

Abstract: Mutation testing is an effective technique for assessing the effectiveness of test suites by systematically injecting artificial faults into programs. However, existing mutation testing techniques fall short in capturing many types of common faults in dynamically typed languages like Python. In this paper, we introduce a novel set of seven mutation operators that are inspired by prevalent anti-patterns in Python programs, designed to complement the existing general-purpose operators and broaden the spectrum of simulated faults. We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants. We implement our approach in a tool called PyTation and evaluate it on 13 open-source Python applications. Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites. We further demonstrate that PyTation produces a high proportion of unique mutants, a low cross-kill rate, and a low test overlap ratio relative to baseline tools, highlighting its novel fault model. PyTation also incurs few equivalent mutants, aided by dynamic analysis heuristics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is increasingly used for code-centric tasks. These tasks include code generation, summarization, understanding, repair, testing, and optimization. This trend is growing faster with large language models and autonomous agents. A key challenge is how to design reward signals that make sense for software. In many RL problems, the reward is a clear number. In software, this is often not possible. The goal is rarely a single numeric objective. Instead, rewards are usually proxies. Common proxies check if the code compiles, passes tests, or satisfies quality metrics. Many reward designs have been proposed for code-related tasks. However, the work is scattered across areas and papers. There is no single survey that brings these approaches together and shows the full landscape of reward design for RL in software. In this survey, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive review of reward engineering for RL in software tasks. We focus on existing methods and techniques. We structure the literature along three complementary dimensions, summarizing the reward-design choices within each. We conclude with challenges and recommendations in the reward design space for SE tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation boost productivity but frequently introduce Knowledge Conflicting Hallucinations (KCHs), subtle, semantic errors, such as non-existent API parameters, that evade linters and cause runtime failures. Existing mitigations like constrained decoding or non-deterministic LLM-in-the-loop repair are often unreliable for these errors. This paper investigates whether a deterministic, static-analysis framework can reliably detect \textit{and} auto-correct KCHs. We propose a post-processing framework that parses generated code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and validates it against a dynamically-generated Knowledge Base (KB) built via library introspection. This non-executing approach uses deterministic rules to find and fix both API and identifier-level conflicts. On a manually-curated dataset of 200 Python snippets, our framework detected KCHs with 100\% precision and 87.6\% recall (0.934 F1-score), and successfully auto-corrected 77.0\% of all identified hallucinations. Our findings demonstrate that this deterministic post-processing approach is a viable and reliable alternative to probabilistic repair, offering a clear path toward trustworthy code generation.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) provides early feedback by automatically building software, but long build durations can hinder developer productivity. CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of specialized LLM-based detectors and compare them with traditional static analyzers at the project scale. Specifically, our study evaluates five latest and representative LLM-based methods and two traditional tools using: 1) an in-house benchmark of 222 known real-world vulnerabilities (C/C++ and Java) to assess detection capability, and 2) 24 active open-source projects, where we manually inspected 385 warnings to assess their practical usability and underlying root causes of failures. Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes. Overall, our findings underscore critical limitations in the robustness, reliability, and scalability of current LLM-based detectors. We ultimately summarize a set of implications for future research toward more effective and practical project-scale vulnerability detection.

Abstract: The discussion around AI-Engineering, that is, Software Engineering (SE) for AI-enabled Systems, cannot ignore a crucial class of software systems that are increasingly becoming AI-enhanced: Those used to enable or support the SE process, such as Computer-Aided SE (CASE) tools and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). In this paper, we study the energy efficiency of these systems. As AI becomes seamlessly available in these tools and, in many cases, is active by default, we are entering a new era with significant implications for energy consumption patterns throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). We focus on advanced Machine Learning (ML) capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our proposed approach combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Prompt Engineering Techniques (PETs) to enhance both the quality and energy efficiency of LLM-based code generation. We present a comprehensive framework that measures real-time energy consumption and inference time across diverse model architectures ranging from 125M to 7B parameters, including GPT-2, CodeLlama, Qwen 2.5, and DeepSeek Coder. These LLMs, chosen for practical reasons, are sufficient to validate the core ideas and provide a proof of concept for more in-depth future analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made it remarkably easy to synthesize plausible source code from natural language prompts. While this accelerates software development and supports learning, it also raises new risks for academic integrity, authorship attribution, and responsible AI use. This paper investigates the problem of distinguishing human-written from machine-generated code by comparing two complementary approaches: feature-based detectors built from lightweight, interpretable stylometric and structural properties of code, and embedding-based detectors leveraging pretrained code encoders. Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965). Analysis shows that features tied to indentation and whitespace provide particularly discriminative cues, whereas embeddings capture deeper semantic patterns and yield slightly higher precision. These findings underscore the trade-offs between interpretability and generalization, offering practical guidance for deploying robust code-origin detection in academic and industrial contexts.

Abstract: While prior work has examined the generation capabilities of Agentic AI systems, little is known about how reviewers respond to AI-authored code in practice. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of code review dynamics in agent-generated PRs. Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns. These findings suggest that while AI agents can accelerate code production, there remain gaps requiring targeted human review oversight.

Abstract: Empirical software engineering research often depends on datasets of code repository artifacts, where sampling strategies are employed to enable large-scale analyses. The design and evaluation of these strategies are critical, as they directly influence the generalizability of research findings. However, sampling remains an underestimated aspect in software engineering research: we identify two main challenges related to (1) the design and representativeness of sampling approaches, and (2) the ability to reason about the implications of sampling decisions on generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling. Our results show that the DSL can model the sampling strategies reported in recent literature.

Abstract: Code comments serve a crucial role in software development for documenting functionality, clarifying design choices, and assisting with issue tracking. They capture developers' insights about the surrounding source code, serving as an essential resource for both human comprehension and automated analysis. Nevertheless, since comments are in natural language, they present challenges for machine-based code understanding. To address this, recent studies have applied natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify comments according to developers' intentions. However, existing datasets for this task suffer from size limitations and class imbalance, as they rely on manual annotations and may not accurately represent the distribution of comments in real-world codebases. To overcome this issue, we introduce new synthetic oversampling and augmentation techniques based on high-quality data generation to enhance the NLBSE'26 challenge datasets. Our Synthetic Quality Oversampling Technique and Augmentation Technique (Q-SYNTH) yield promising results, improving the base classifier by $2.56\%$.

Abstract: As GenAI models are adopted to support software engineers and their development teams, understanding effective human-AI collaboration (HAIC) is increasingly important. Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment.

Abstract: High-quality evaluation benchmarks are pivotal for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Code Review (ACR). However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an "AI-assisted, Expert-verified" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285\% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed. The code, data, and other artifacts of our evaluation set are available at https://github.com/alibaba/aacr-bench .

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Software architecture is inherently knowledge-centric. The architectural knowledge is distributed across heterogeneous software artifacts such as requirements documents, design diagrams, code, and documentation, making it difficult for developers to access and utilize this knowledge effectively. Moreover, as systems evolve, inconsistencies frequently emerge between these artifacts, leading to architectural erosion and impeding maintenance activities. We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base. This knowledge base enables critical activities such as architecture conformance checking and change impact analysis, while supporting natural language question-answering to improve access to architectural knowledge. To realize this vision, we plan to develop specialized extractors for different artifact types, design a unified knowledge representation schema, implement consistency checking mechanisms, and integrate retrieval-augmented generation techniques for conversational knowledge access.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are becoming central to software engineering tasks, yet evaluating them remains fragmented and largely model-centric. Existing studies overlook how architectural components, such as planners, memory, and tool routers, shape agent behavior, limiting diagnostic power. We propose a lightweight, architecture-informed approach that links agent components to their observable behaviors and to the metrics capable of evaluating them. Our method clarifies what to measure and why, and we illustrate its application through real world agents, enabling more targeted, transparent, and actionable evaluation of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Rising publication pressure and the routine use of generative AI tools are reshaping how software engineering research is produced, assessed, and taught. While these developments promise efficiency, they also raise concerns about skill degradation, responsibility, and trust in scholarly outputs. This vision paper employs Design Fiction as a methodological lens to examine how such concerns might materialise if current practices persist. Drawing on themes reported in a recent community survey, we construct a speculative artifact situated in a near future research setting. The fiction is used as an analytical device rather than a forecast, enabling reflection on how automated assistance might impede domain knowledge competence, verification, and mentoring practices. By presenting an intentionally unsettling scenario, the paper invites discussion on how the software engineering research community in the future will define proficiency, allocate responsibility, and support learning.

Abstract: Vulnerability identifiers such as CVE, CWE, and GHSA are standardised references to known software security issues, yet their use in practice is not well understood. This paper compares vulnerability ID use in GitHub pull requests authored by autonomous agents, bots, and human developers. Using the AIDev pop dataset and an augmented set of pull requests from the same repositories, we analyse who mentions vulnerability identifiers and where they appear. Bots account for around 69.1% of all mentions, usually adding few identifiers in pull request descriptions, while human and agent mentions are rarer but span more locations. Qualitative analysis shows that bots mainly reference identifiers in automated dependency updates and audits, whereas humans and agents use them to support fixes, maintenance, and discussion.

Abstract: Generative AI plays an increasing role during software engineering activities to make them, e.g., more efficient or provide better quality. However, it is often unclear how much benefit LLMs really provide. We concentrate on software architects and investigated how an LLM-supported evaluation of architecture documents can support software architects to improve such artefacts. In the context of a research project where a digital marketplace is developed and digital solutions should be analyzed, we used different LLMs to analyze the quality of architecture documents and compared the results with evaluations from software architects. We found out that the quality of the artifact has a strong influence on the quality of the LLM, i.e., the better the quality of the architecture document was, the more consistent were the LLM-based evaluation and the human expert evaluation. While using LLMs in this architecture task is promising, our results showed inconsistencies that need further analyses before generalizing them.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Repository-level code completion remains a challenging task for existing code large language models (code LLMs) due to their limited understanding of repository-specific context and domain knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark. The results show that our framework achieves superior performance and exhibits high generalizability across various code LLMs and programming languages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.

Abstract: As large language models become integral to agentic artificial intelligence systems, their energy demands during inference may pose significant sustainability challenges. This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Results show that smaller open-weights models can lower energy usage while preserving task quality. Building on these findings, we propose practical guidelines for sustainable artificial intelligence design, including optimal batch size configuration and computation resource allocation. These insights offer actionable strategies for developing scalable, environmentally responsible artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.

Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/yhz5613813/RPO.

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

Abstract: This work presents (i) a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a power system with line dynamics and heterogeneous bus dynamics, (ii) a novel reduced-order model of damper windings in synchronous machines, and (iii) a proportional-derivative (PD) damper winding emulation control for voltage-source converters (VSCs). Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation.

Abstract: The prosthetic socket is an essential part in ensuring comfort and stability for the overall prosthesis system. This study proposes a multi-material/thickness individualized transtibial prosthetic socket that focuses on providing comfort. This study aims to identify the proper material and thickness to protect Calf areas and reduce the pressure around bone areas. First, the socket is divided into four parts depending on the pressure-sensitive/tolerant regions. After identifying the thickness range for each concerned area, the thickness and material are selected based on the Pressure-Pain Threshold (PPT) test, and the finalized design is then prototyped. The prototyped individualized socket (i-Socket) is 22% lighter than the participant's own socket. Results of the pilot experiments with an amputee participant showed that the pressure inside the socket decreased by 45% and 31% for the Tibia and Fibula regions, respectively. Additionally, the self-selected CoM velocity for the walking experiment is increased by 15% compared to the similar studies in the literature. Regarding the kinematic results, symmetry in the knee and ankle joints increased by 65% and 2% when using the i-Socket compared to the results with the participant's own socket.

Abstract: Using actual flight data from a 50-cm-class microsatellite whose mission and operations have already been completed, this study re-evaluates satellite attitude determination performance and the error characteristics of onboard attitude sensors. While conventional approaches rely on batch estimation or Kalman filtering based on predefined physical models and white-noise assumptions, this research introduces a machine-learning-based approach to extract and correct structural and nonlinear error patterns embedded in real observational data. In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination.

Abstract: This paper presents a theory-to-hardware framework for fully passive millimeter-wave beam control aimed at extending indoor coverage. The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.

Abstract: As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.

Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.

Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.

Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics.

Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.

Abstract: This article presents an eco-driving algorithm for electric vehicles featuring multi-speed transmissions. The proposed controller is formulated as a co-optimization problem, simultaneously optimizing both vehicle longitudinal speed and powertrain operation to maximize energy efficiency. Constraints derived from a connected vehicle based traffic prediction algorithm are used to ensure traffic safety and smooth traffic flow in dynamic environments with multiple signalized intersections and mixed traffic. By simplifying the complex, nonlinear mixed integer problem, the proposed controller achieves computational efficiency, enabling real-time implementation. To evaluate its performance, traffic scenarios from both Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and real-world road tests are employed. The results demonstrate a notable reduction in energy consumption by up to 11.36\% over an \SI{18}{\km} drive.

Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian neural networks have shown promising results in the identification of nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, as their combination of physical principles with data-driven learning allows for accurate modelling. However, due to the non-convex optimization problem inherent in learning the correct network parameters, the training procedure is prone to converging to local minima, potentially leading to poor performance. In order to avoid this issue, this paper proposes an improved initialization for port-Hamiltonian neural networks. The core idea is to first estimate a linear port-Hamiltonian system to be used as an initialization for the network, after which the neural network adapts to the system nonlinearities, reducing the training times and improving convergence. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a chained mass-spring-damper setup for varying noise levels and compared to the original approach.

Abstract: We study damping of inter-area oscillations in transmission grids using voltage-source-converter-based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) links. Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice. Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) addresses this limitation by replacing explicit models with data. We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.

Abstract: Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.

Abstract: With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, recommender systems have been increasingly used across a vast variety of platforms to efficiently and effectively match users with items. As application contexts become more diverse and complex, there is a growing need for more sophisticated recommendation techniques. One example is the composite item (for example, fashion outfit) recommendation where multiple levels of user preference information might be available and relevant. In this study, we propose JIMA, a joint interaction modeling approach that uses a single model to take advantage of all data from different levels of granularity and incorporate interactions to learn the complex relationships among lower-order (atomic item) and higher-order (composite item) user preferences as well as domain expertise (e.g., on the stylistic fit). We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method and compare it with advanced baselines through multiple simulation studies as well as with real data in both offline and online settings. The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.

Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.

Abstract: In the era of explosive growth in academic literature, the burden of literature review on scholars are increasing. Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches.

Abstract: Although generative recommenders demonstrate improved performance with longer sequences, their real-time deployment is hindered by substantial computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method for compressing long-term user histories by leveraging inherent item categorical features, thereby preserving user interests while enhancing efficiency. Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that, compared to the influential HSTU model, our approach achieves up to a 6x reduction in computational cost and up to 39% higher accuracy at comparable cost (i.e., similar sequence length).

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation systems has introduced unprecedented capabilities for natural language understanding, explanation generation, and conversational interactions. However, existing evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on traditional accuracy metrics, failing to capture the multifaceted human-centered qualities that determine the real-world user experience. We introduce \framework{} (\textbf{H}uman-centered \textbf{E}valuation for \textbf{L}LM-powered reco\textbf{M}menders), a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM-powered recommender systems across five human-centered dimensions: \textit{Intent Alignment}, \textit{Explanation Quality}, \textit{Interaction Naturalness}, \textit{Trust \& Transparency}, and \textit{Fairness \& Diversity}. Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58). We release \framework{} as an open-source toolkit to advance human-centered evaluation practices in the recommender systems community.

Abstract: Multimodal Recommendation (MMR) systems are crucial for modern platforms but are often hampered by inherent noise and uncertainty in modal features, such as blurry images, diverse visual appearances, or ambiguous text. Existing methods often overlook this modality-specific uncertainty, leading to ineffective feature fusion. Furthermore, they fail to leverage rich similarity patterns among users and items to refine representations and their corresponding uncertainty estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPUMR achieves significant improvements over existing leading methods.

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce recommender systems primarily optimize for user engagement and purchase likelihood, often neglecting the rigid physiological constraints required for human health. Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) aim to retrieve a small set of items that best match individual user preferences. Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.
  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos. The code is available at https://github.com/cynthia-shengjia/WWW-2026-Talos.

Abstract: Large language models have recently shown promise for multimodal recommendation, particularly with text and image inputs. Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Most conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on relevance-based retrieval, which often misaligns with utility -- that is, whether the retrieved passages actually improve the quality of the generated text specific to a downstream task such as question answering or query-based summarization. The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of a large language model (LLM) based semantic search tool relative to a traditional keyword-based search for data discovery. Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve. Overall, the findings suggest that LLM driven semantic search offers a substantial improvement for data discovery, complementing rather than fully replacing traditional keyword-based approaches.

Abstract: Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code3-18D3/.

Abstract: Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.
  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction.

Abstract: Recent advances in modern containerized execution environments have resulted in substantial benefits in terms of elasticity and more efficient utilization of computing resources. Although existing schedulers strive to optimize performance metrics like task execution times and resource utilization, they provide limited transparency into their decision-making processes or the specific actions developers must take to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In this work, we propose X-Sched, a middleware that uses explainability techniques to generate actionable guidance on resource configurations that makes task execution in containerized environments feasible, under resource and time constraints. X-Sched addresses this gap by integrating counterfactual explanations with advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forests, to efficiently identify optimal configurations. This approach not only ensures that tasks are executed in line with performance goals but also gives users clear, actionable insights into the rationale behind scheduling decisions. Our experimental results validated with data from real-world execution environments, illustrate the efficiency, benefits and practicality of our approach.

Abstract: Scaling modern deep learning workloads demands coordinated placement of data and compute across device meshes, memory hierarchies, and heterogeneous accelerators. We present Axe Layout, a hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space via named axes. Axe unifies tiling, sharding, replication, and offsets across inter-device distribution and on-device layouts, enabling collective primitives to be expressed consistently from device meshes to threads. Building on Axe, we design a multi-granularity, distribution-aware DSL and compiler that composes thread-local control with collective operators in a single kernel. Experiments show that our unified approach can bring performance close to hand-tuned kernels on across latest GPU devices and multi-device environments and accelerator backends.

Abstract: FaaS platforms rely on cluster managers like Kubernetes for resource management. Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.
  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller. Experiments show that KUBEDIRECT reduces serving latency by 26.7x over Knative, and has similar performance as the state-of-the-art clean-slate platform Dirigent.

Abstract: Modern data parallel (DP) training favors collective communication over parameter servers (PS) for its simplicity and efficiency under balanced workloads. However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training. Our implementation of ODC and integration with FSDP is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/odc.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) unlock unprecedented multimodal and multitask intelligence, yet their cloud-centric deployment precludes real-time responsiveness and compromises user privacy. Meanwhile, monolithic execution at the edge remains infeasible under stringent resource limits and uncertain network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations. Simulations demonstrate that our framework achieves over 84% average on-time task completion with moderate deployment costs and maintains strong robustness as the system load scales.
