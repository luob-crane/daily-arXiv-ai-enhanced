Abstract: The neutron radiative capture reaction $^{17}$O(n,$γ$)18O plays a pivotal role in both nuclear structure studies and astrophysical nucleosynthesis, particularly in the formation of elements during hydrostatic and explosive stellar environments. We calculated the $^{17}$O(n,$γ$)$^{18}$O cross section within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock potential model and analyzed electric dipole E1 transitions to both positive and negative-parity states below the alpha-decay threshold in $^{18}$O. Our cross sections are significantly different from the data available in commonly used libraries. We further investigate the impact of the new calculated cross section on weak r-process nucleosynthesis using large-scale reaction network calculations across a wide range of electron fractions and entropies. Our results show that the $^{17}$O(n, $γ$)$^{18}$O reaction rate significantly influences the production of first r-process peak elements, such as strontium, under specific astrophysical conditions. This study highlights the importance of accurate nuclear dat$ for light isotopes in modeling heavy-element synthesis and provides updated reaction rates for future nucleosynthesis simulations.

Abstract: The low-energy nuclear isomeric state of \textsuperscript{229m}Th provides a unique bridge between nuclear and atomic physics, enabling applications such as nuclear clocks and precision metrology. However, efficient and controllable production of \textsuperscript{229m}Th remains a major experimental challenge. We propose an efficient scheme to produce the $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th in storage rings (SRs) and electron beam ion traps (EBITs), using a cascade decay pathway. Highly charged ions are excited to higher nuclear states via nuclear excitation by inelastic electron scattering (NEIES) and nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC), followed by radiative or internal conversion cascades that populate the isomer. Our calculations demonstrate that, under typical SRs and EBITs conditions, optimized indirect excitation pathways significantly enhance \textsuperscript{229m}Th production rate. In particular, NEIES can provide an enhancement of up to four orders of magnitude through cascade de-excitation at high energies, while NEEC can contribute an additional enhancement of up to several tens of times. Such a significant increase in the \textsuperscript{229m}Th yield rate would facilitate its application in various nuclear photonics fields, especially in the development of atomic nuclear clocks.

Abstract: The correlation between vorticity and spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions can be probed through polarization measurements of hadrons, whose total spin originates from both constituent-quark spins and orbital angular momentum in the quark-model framework. To motivate such experimental studies, we calculate the general angular distribution of produced pion in $f_2(1270)\toπ+π$ using interaction Lagrangian and helicity formalism and check that both methods yield the same result. The distribution is given as a function of angle between pion and initial quantization axis of $f_2$ and the spin density matrix element of $f_2$. Its diagonal entries and $ρ_{20}$ component were computed assuming local thermal equilibrium and blast wave model for different centrality classes, hence given as a function of azimuthal angle with respect to the impact parameter.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of AI technologies, exemplified by BERT-family models, has transformed scientific research, yet little is known about their production and recognition dynamics in the scientific system. This study investigates the development and impact of BERT-family models, focusing on team size, topic specialization, and citation patterns behind the models. Using a dataset of 4,208 BERT-related papers from the Papers with Code (PWC) dataset, we analyze how the BERT-family models evolve across methodological generations and how the newness of models is correlated with their production and recognition. Our findings reveal that newer BERT models are developed by larger, more experienced, and institutionally diverse teams, reflecting the increasing complexity of AI research. Additionally, these models exhibit greater topical specialization, targeting niche applications, which aligns with broader trends in scientific specialization. However, newer models receive fewer citations, particularly over the long term, suggesting a "first-mover advantage," where early models like BERT garner disproportionate recognition. These insights highlight the need for equitable evaluation frameworks that value both foundational and incremental innovations. This study underscores the evolving interplay between collaboration, specialization, and recognition in AI research.

### [5] [Direct Measurement of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,α)^{56}$Ni Excitation Function to Constrain the Ni--Cu Cycle Strength and Its Impact on Explosive Nucleosynthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22262)

Abstract: A new direct measurement of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,α){}^{56}$Ni excitation function from 2.43 to 5.88~MeV in the center-of-mass frame was performed in inverse kinematics using the high-efficiency MUSIC active-target detector at FRIB. This reaction plays a critical role in constraining the strength of the Ni--Cu cycle in explosive astrophysical environments such as Type~I X-ray bursts and the $ν$p-process in neutrino-driven winds following core-collapse supernovae. The newly derived stellar reaction rate is systematically lower than the REACLIB evaluation, resulting in less than 0.1\% recycling through the Ni--Cu cycle in X-ray bursts and an enhanced efficiency of the $ν$p-process up to temperatures of $T_9 \approx 3.7$.

Abstract: The $^{59}$Cu$(p,α)^{56}$Ni reaction plays an important role in explosive astrophysical scenarios such as Type I X-ray bursts and the $νp$-process in neutrino-driven winds following a core-collapse supernova. In both cases, this reaction has been proposed to significantly affect the synthesis of heavier nuclei by regulating the flow of nucleosynthesis through the Ni--Cu cycle. In this work, we present a direct measurement of the $^{59}\mathrm{Cu}(p,α)^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ excitation function from 2.43--5.88 MeV in the center-of-mass frame. The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics using the high-efficiency MUSIC active-target detector at FRIB. This measurement allowed tight constraints to be placed on the astrophysical reaction rate. The derived stellar rate is systematically lower than the REACLIB rate and remains below the competing $(p,γ)$ rate for $T_9 \lesssim 3$.
