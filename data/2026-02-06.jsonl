To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality."}

Project website: https://vista-vla.github.io/", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which \"general intelligence\" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain."}

Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives.

The method involves solving an inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation to determine the non-normalizable resonant state by identifying a normalizable source state, which captures the short-range internal structure. The long-range behavior is then calculated using the free three-body propagator, providing accurate asymptotic coefficients necessary for describing decay correlations. We apply this formalism to the two-neutron decay of the 0$^{+}$ ground-state and the 2$^{+}$ excited-state resonances of $^{16}\\text{Be}$ ($^{14}\\text{Be}+n+n$), working within the hyperspherical expansion method with an analytical transformed harmonic oscillator basis. Our results show that the decay is strongly dominated by the lowest hypermomentum components at large separations, reflecting effective three-body barrier penetration dynamics that shape the final state. The calculated relative-energy distributions exhibit clear neutron-neutron correlations for both states, arising from mixing between different asymptotic channels, and are consistent with a direct two-neutron emission mechanism, in agreement with recent experimental observations. This work provides a reliable tool for linking the internal structure of three-body resonances to their decay properties."}

As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs."}

We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior."}

We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates."}

To balance power efficiency and estimation performance, we formulate the scheduling task as a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) problem. By analyzing the structure of the optimal Q-function, we show that the resulting scheduling policy exhibits a semantic structure that adapts online to the estimation error covariance and channel variations. To obtain a practical solution, we derive a tractable upper bound on the Q-function via a positive semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition, which enables an efficient approximate scheduling policy and a low-complexity remote estimation algorithm. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in both estimation accuracy and power efficiency."}

In this paper, we present VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for Verus, a state-of-the-art verification tool for system software written in Rust. Through self-synthesis and tutorial-based synthesis, VeruSyn achieves much larger scale and Verus-feature coverage than previous data-synthesis techniques designed for Verus; VeruSyn also supplements its dataset with long-chain-of-thought (CoT) data through agent trajectory synthesis. With VeruSyn, we synthesize the largest set of Verus verified programs: 6.9 million Rust programs, each with a formal specification and a proof that it meets that specification.

We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction.

Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns.

We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.\n  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.\n  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving."}

Despite review by 3-5 expert researchers per paper, these fabricated citations evaded detection, appearing in 53 published papers (approx. 1% of all accepted papers). We develop a five-category taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by their failure mode: Total Fabrication (66%), Partial Attribute Corruption (27%), Identifier Hijacking (4%), Placeholder Hallucination (2%), and Semantic Hallucination (1%). Our analysis reveals a critical finding: every hallucination (100%) exhibited compound failure modes. The distribution of secondary characteristics was dominated by Semantic Hallucination (63%) and Identifier Hijacking (29%), which often appeared alongside Total Fabrication to create a veneer of plausibility and false verifiability. These compound structures exploit multiple verification heuristics simultaneously, explaining why peer review fails to detect them. The distribution exhibits a bimodal pattern: 92% of contaminated papers contain 1-2 hallucinations (minimal AI use) while 8% contain 4-13 hallucinations (heavy reliance). These findings demonstrate that current peer review processes do not include effective citation verification and that the problem extends beyond NeurIPS to other major conferences, government reports, and professional consulting.

A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes."}

This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \\emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \\emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?\n  We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \\emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $ε$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $ε$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \\log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - ε)$. Crucially, any $ε$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $ε$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $ε$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \\log f)$."}

This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems."}

To bridge this gap, we develop a GPU-to-Grid framework that couples device-level GPU control with power system objectives. We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems. Our key insight is that reducing GPU power consumption alleviates violations of lower voltage limits, while increasing GPU power mitigates violations near upper voltage limits in distribution systems; this runs counter to the common belief that minimizing GPU power consumption is always beneficial to power grids."}

Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes.

Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.\n  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.\n  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.\n  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning."}

However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats."}

DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\\sf{col}(v) \\in C = \\{c_1, \\dots, c_t\\}, t\\leq n$.

Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.\n  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION."}

However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics."}

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness."}

This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value. The quality model has been successfully integrated into an open-source tool for ML component testing and evaluation demonstrating its practical application."}

In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\\%$ threshold on this benchmark.

We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs."}

This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners."}

A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the \"price of autonomy,\" where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators' policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows. These findings validate the proposed framework's ability to deliver practical benefits of orchestrated multi-operator collaboration in future NTN environments."}

In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems.

The main strength of the proposed approach is the enforcement of the desired reference model in closed-loop under sliding mode conditions, despite the lack of knowledge of the model dynamics and the presence of the matched disturbances. Moreover, the conditions required to guarantee an integral sliding mode generation and the closed-loop stability are formally analyzed in the paper, remarking the generality of the proposed data-driven integral sliding mode control (DD-ISMC) with respect to the related model-based counterpart.

Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks. We also call attention to the fact that exception-raising behaviors are not necessarily \"abnormal\" or rare."}

We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \\modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\\times$ to $65\\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches."}

To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text.

Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality.

We propose a vision for drift observability on the simplex: model drift and boundary proximity in Aitchison geometry to obtain coordinate-invariant direction and distance-to-safety in interpretable balance coordinates. To remain comparable under churn, a monitor would continuously refresh its part inventory and policy-defined boundaries from engineering artifacts and apply lineage-aware aggregation.

While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components. The findings demonstrate the importance of revising existing safety frameworks to address the evolving challenges posed by AI, ensuring comprehensive safety assurance across all component classifications spanning multiple safety standards."}

To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively."}

To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality.

DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics."}

Vector Space Modelling (VSM) and neural word embeddings play a crucial role in modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Embeddings use distributional semantics to represent words, sentences, paragraphs or entire documents as vectors in high dimensional spaces. This can be leveraged by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to exploit the semantic relatedness between queries and answers.\n  This paper evaluates an alternative approach to measuring query statement similarity that moves away from the common similarity measure of centroids of neural word embeddings. Motivated by the Word Movers Distance (WMD) model, similarity is evaluated using the distance between individual words of queries and statements. Results from ranked query and response statements demonstrate significant gains in accuracy using the combined approach of similarity ranking through WMD with the word embedding techniques. The top performing WMD + GloVe combination outperforms all other state-of-the-art retrieval models including Doc2Vec and the baseline LSA model. Along with the significant gains in performance of similarity ranking through WMD, we conclude that the use of pre-trained word embeddings, trained on vast amounts of data, result in domain agnostic language processing solutions that are portable to diverse business use-cases."}

Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives.

However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \\modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model.

An Empirical Study of Fuzzing Bug Detection", "comment": "Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2026). 12 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Fuzzing has become a popular technique for automatically detecting vulnerabilities and bugs by generating unexpected inputs. In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development."}

These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets."}

In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation."}

In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving method that protects each agent's reference signal from external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious agents while achieving the same convergence accuracy and convergence rate as conventional DAC. Our approach masks the reference signals by having each agent draw a random real number for each neighbor, exchanges that number over an encrypted channel at the initialization, and computes a masking value to form a masked reference. Then the agents run the conventional DAC algorithm using the masked references. Convergence and privacy analyses show that the proposed algorithm matches the convergence properties of conventional DAC while preserving the privacy of the reference signals. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving DAC algorithm."}

Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries.

This limitation is especially problematic for systems that rely on neural network (NN)-based state estimators, which can be highly sensitive to noise and adversarial input perturbations. We address these problems by introducing GUARDIAN: Guaranteed Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Defense against Adversarial INterference, a safety filtering framework that provides formal safety guarantees for systems with NN-based state estimators. At runtime, GUARDIAN uses neural network verification tools to provide guaranteed bounds on the system's state estimate given possible perturbations to its observation. It then uses a modified Hamilton-Jacobi reachability formulation to construct a safety filter that adjusts the nominal control input based on the verified state bounds and safety constraints. The result is an uncertainty-aware filter that ensures safety despite the system's reliance on an NN estimator with noisy, possibly adversarial, input observations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that GUARDIAN effectively defends systems against adversarial attacks that would otherwise lead to a violation of safety constraints."}

They interfere with automated quality assurance of code changes and hinder efficient software testing. Previous work evaluated approaches to train machine learning models to classify flaky tests based on identifiers in the test code. However, the resulting classifiers have been shown to lack generalizability, hindering their applicability in practical environments. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generalize across various tasks. Thus, they represent a promising approach to address the generalizability problem of previous approaches. In this study, we evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose models, one code-specific model) using three prompting techniques on two benchmark datasets from prior studies on flaky test classification. Furthermore, we manually investigated 50 samples from the given datasets to determine whether classifying flaky tests based only on test code is feasible for humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to classify flaky tests given only the test code. The results of our best prompt-model combination were only marginally better than random guessing. In our manual analysis, we found that the test code does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a flakiness classification. Our findings motivate future work to evaluate LLMs for flakiness classification with additional context, for example, using retrieval-augmented generation or agentic AI."}

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior."}

Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components. The findings demonstrate the importance of revising existing safety frameworks to address the evolving challenges posed by AI, ensuring comprehensive safety assurance across all component classifications spanning multiple safety standards."}

We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained.

In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting."}

Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families. Our work contributes a valuable technique and tool for future LLM evaluations, and a large dataset characterising the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models in this domain."}

Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters."}

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments."}

Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding."}

In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs."}

The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the \\textit{Tactical Loop} for code-level refinement, while the \\textit{Strategic Loop} for attack strategy replanning.

Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations.

Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes.

We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity. We also include an analysis of customization on two public benchmarks and present opportunities for future work."}

However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality."}

To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings."}

Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance."}

We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets."}

However, their reasoning process often remains a \"fast thinking\" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, \"slow thinking\" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes."}

Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override."}

We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090."}

In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program.

This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others.

Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark.

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings.

Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training.

To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks.

However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime.

Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features.

By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates.

Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks.

Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the \"divide and conquer\" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts.

Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization.

Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images.

We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\\% in Sports and 4.59\\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\\% and 3.49\\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\\% in cold-start and 11.9\\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\\% in Beauty and 23.16\\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications."}

Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method."}

Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation.

We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior.

However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios."}

In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively.

To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts."}

To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m.

We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage.

In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model.

We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise.

Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference."}

Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos."}

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions."}

Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction. Then, we refine this geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. By leveraging 2D vision priors, we mitigate artifacts from erroneous pose estimation in template-based methods and employ multiple reference frames to resolve the invisibility issue of 2D keypoints in a template-free manner.

Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA.

Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).\n  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.\n  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures."}

To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training."}

To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems."}

As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous \"separation of concerns\" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented \"victim modeling\" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions).

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs."}

We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting."}

The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP."}

We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders.

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI).

However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches."}

Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT).

Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \\key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges.

Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources."}

Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization.

This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value. The quality model has been successfully integrated into an open-source tool for ML component testing and evaluation demonstrating its practical application."}

In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models."}

Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections).

Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models."}

In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

To address these challenges, we propose Entropy-Guided Stepwise Scaling (EGSS), a novel TTS framework that dynamically balances efficiency and effectiveness through entropy-guided adaptive search and robust test-suite augmentation. Extensive experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that EGSS consistently boosts performance by 5-10% across all evaluated models.

However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification.

Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the \"divide and conquer\" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts.

FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence.

Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps.

We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process.

However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios."}

While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes."}

To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates.

To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos."}

While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty."}

Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

We introduce CTF challenge families, whereby a single CTF is used as the basis for generating a family of semantically-equivalent challenges via semantics-preserving program transformations. This enables controlled evaluation of agent robustness to source code transformations while keeping the underlying exploit strategy fixed. We introduce a new tool, Evolve-CTF, that generates CTF families from Python challenges using a range of transformations. Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families. Our work contributes a valuable technique and tool for future LLM evaluations, and a large dataset characterising the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models in this domain."}

We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet."}

This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%.

Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources."}

Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding."}

In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium.

Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement.

Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities.

Despite the increased performance of LLMs on public benchmarks, out of the box LLMs still have a hard time generating code that aligns with a private code repository not previously seen by the model's training data. Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity. We also include an analysis of customization on two public benchmarks and present opportunities for future work."}

However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \\modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \\modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings."}

Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability.

In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium.

Despite review by 3-5 expert researchers per paper, these fabricated citations evaded detection, appearing in 53 published papers (approx. 1% of all accepted papers). We develop a five-category taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by their failure mode: Total Fabrication (66%), Partial Attribute Corruption (27%), Identifier Hijacking (4%), Placeholder Hallucination (2%), and Semantic Hallucination (1%). Our analysis reveals a critical finding: every hallucination (100%) exhibited compound failure modes. The distribution of secondary characteristics was dominated by Semantic Hallucination (63%) and Identifier Hijacking (29%), which often appeared alongside Total Fabrication to create a veneer of plausibility and false verifiability. These compound structures exploit multiple verification heuristics simultaneously, explaining why peer review fails to detect them. The distribution exhibits a bimodal pattern: 92% of contaminated papers contain 1-2 hallucinations (minimal AI use) while 8% contain 4-13 hallucinations (heavy reliance).

High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment."}

However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker."}

However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as \"visual thoughts\" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods."}

While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios."}

Supplementary material is included at the end of the main paper (16 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables)", "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research."}

Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization."}
