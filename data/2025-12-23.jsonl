This cycle takes place in our Sun and fuels massive, Red, and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. The $^{13}$C(p,$γ$)$^{14}$N rate affects the final abundances of $^{12,13}$C and $^{19}$F nuclides, with impact on our understanding of the i- and s-process, giant star nucleosynthesis and mixing processes, and ultimately the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Here, we report on a new measurement of the $^{13}$C(p,$γ$)$^{14}$N cross-section, which has been performed at the Felsenkeller shallow-underground laboratory in Dresden (Germany). The present $S$-factor results agree at low energy with LUNA data but are about 20% lower than previous literature data over the whole energy range explored, $E\\,=\\,$310-680 keV. The narrow resonance corresponding to the 7966.9(5) keV excited state has been investigated and we report a new resonance strength, $ωγ\\,=\\,$18(2) meV. In addition a new R-matrix fit is presented, from which new parameters for the broad resonance corresponding to the 8062.0(10) keV excited state are derived and a new extrapolation for the total $S$-factor down to zero energy is obtained, $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$(0) = 6.4(4) keV b. Finally a new reaction rate is calculated and reported here."}

In this rotating fluid, the spins of quarks become polarized due to the coupling between spin and angular momentum, as well as random spin-spin interactions. Since the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation effectively describes the spin polarization of fermions in a medium with a magnetic field, we derive a phenomenological equation analogous to the LL equation for heavy quark spin dynamics in the rotating medium. The spin-angular momentum coupling and random spin-spin interactions are incorporated, leading to a detailed balance of heavy quark spin distributions. This equation provides insight into the spin dynamics of heavy quarks and quarkonium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."}

However, this ratio differs from the intuitive expectation, and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism behind the observed ratio by theoretically describing and analyzing the deuteron- and proton-induced one-proton knockout reactions. Proton-induced one-proton knockout reactions are described within the standard distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) framework, while deuteron-induced one-proton knockout reactions are treated with a new approach, DWIA-BU, that incorporates deuteron breakup into the DWIA. The ratios calculated with the DWIA-BU reproduce the experimental data reasonably, whereas those with the DWIA significantly underestimate them. The ratio of the corresponding elementary cross sections remains about 3.5 regardless of the energy, and the difference in absorption between the deuteron and the proton influences the ratios of knockout cross sections, resulting in agreement between the calculated ratios and the experimental data. It is found that the deuteron breakup is essential to reproduce the experimental ratio. The ratios of the knockout cross sections are primarily determined by the difference in the elementary cross sections and that in the absorption between the deuteron and the proton."}

The additional condition restricts the stiffest admissible behavior of the equation of state and systematically reduces the range of allowed equations of state, with the strongest effect at high densities. The resulting bounds remain consistent with known low- and high-density limits, while the strength of the constraint depends on the density above which the kinetic-theory condition is applied. These bounds can be readily incorporated into future studies of cold, dense matter and used to assess the impact of microscopic stability conditions on equation-of-state inference."}

A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, examine the required fluid-dynamical equations of motion and study the resulting entropy production. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program, which could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics."}

The emulator is constructed using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method applied to snapshots of CDCC solutions computed at sampled points in the optical potential parameter space. The prediction is performed via Galerkin projection onto the reduced basis. I demonstrate the method using deuteron scattering on $^{58}$Ni at 21.6 MeV as a test case, emulating 18 optical potential parameters simultaneously. The emulator reproduces elastic scattering cross sections with errors below 0.1\\% across a wide parameter range. This development enables efficient uncertainty quantification and Bayesian parameter estimation for nuclear reaction calculations that were previously computationally prohibitive."}
