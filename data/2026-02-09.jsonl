The communication graph is selected online by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that minimizes a cost combining communication and distance penalties with degree-regularization terms, while enforcing exact connectivity through a flow-based formulation. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of this NP-hard problem, we develop a three-block ADMM scheme that decomposes the MIQP into a convex quadratic program in relaxed edge and flow variables, a pure binary unconstrained subproblem, and a closed-form auxiliary update. The binary subproblem is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonian and approximately solved via quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). The resulting time-varying, optimizer-generated Laplacians are applied to linear first- and second-order consensus dynamics. Numerical simulations on networks demonstrate that the proposed method produces connected topologies that satisfy degree constraints, achieve consensus, and incur costs comparable to those of classical mixed-integer solvers, thereby illustrating how quantum algorithms can be embedded as topology optimizers within closed-loop distributed control architectures."}

Without requiring ground-truth AC-OPF solutions, feasibility and optimality are ensured through a properly designed learning environment and training loss. Inspired by residual learning, the neural network (NN) learns the correction mapping from the DC-OPF solution to the active power setpoints of the generators through re-dispatch. A subsequent optimization model is utilized to restore the optimal AC-OPF solution, and the resulting projection difference is employed as the training loss. A replay buffer is utilized to enhance learning efficiency by fully leveraging past data pairs. The optimization model is cast as a differentiable optimization layer, where the gradient is derived by applying the implicit function theorem to the KKT conditions at the optimal solution. Tested on IEEE-118 and PEGASE-9241 bus systems, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NN can obtain strictly feasible and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational time compared to conventional optimization solvers. In addition, aided by the updated DC-OPF solution under varying topologies, the trained NN, together with the PF solver, can rapidly find the corresponding AC solution. The proposed method achieves a $40\\times$ time speedup, while maintaining an average constraint violation on the order of $10^{-4}$ and an optimization gap below $1\\%$."}

However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential.\n  The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization.

While safety analysis of stochastic systems using control barrier certificates (CBC) has been widely studied, developing safety controllers for stochastic systems with time delays remains largely unexplored. The main challenge arises from the need to account for the influence of delayed components when formulating and enforcing safety conditions. To address this, we employ Krasovskii control barrier certificates, which extend the conventional CBC framework by augmenting it with an additional summation term that captures the influence of delayed states. This formulation integrates both the current and delayed components into a unified barrier structure, enabling safety synthesis for stochastic systems with time delays. The proposed approach synthesizes safety controllers under input constraints, offering probabilistic safety guarantees robust to such delays: it ensures that all trajectories of the dt-SNPS-td remain within the prescribed safe region while fulfilling a quantified probabilistic bound. To achieve this, our method reformulates the safety constraints as a sum-of-squares optimization program, enabling the systematic construction of Krasovskii CBC together with their associated safety controllers. We validate the proposed framework through three case studies, including two physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability."}

This work introduces QEIL, Quantifying Edge Intelligence via Inference time Scaling Laws, a unified framework for efficient local LLM inference using principled scaling laws and heterogeneous orchestration across CPU, GPU, and NPU accelerators. We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage. Extensive evaluation across five model families from 125M to 2.6B parameters demonstrates consistent gains, including 7 to 10.5 percentage point improvement in pass at k coverage, 35.6 to 78.2 percent energy reduction, 68 percent average power reduction enabling edge thermal budgets, 15.8 percent latency improvement, and zero accuracy loss. Results confirm that inference time scaling laws are universal and architecture agnostic, establishing heterogeneous edge orchestration as the optimal strategy for energy constrained intelligent systems."}

Yet, despite its empirical success, they are primarily built on a \"single-turn\" formulation where each query-target pair is treated as an independent data point. This paradigm leads to computational inefficiency when scaling, as it requires a separate forward pass for each pair and overlooks potential contextual relationships between multiple queries that can relate to the same context. In this work, we introduce Multi-Turn Contrastive Learning (MuCo), a dialogue-inspired framework that revisits this process. MuCo leverages the conversational nature of MLLMs to process multiple, related query-target pairs associated with a single image within a single forward pass. This allows us to extract a set of multiple query and target embeddings simultaneously, conditioned on a shared context representation, amplifying the effective batch size and overall training efficiency. Experiments exhibit MuCo with a newly curated 5M multimodal multi-turn dataset (M3T), which yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB and M-BEIR benchmarks, while markedly enhancing both training efficiency and representation coherence across modalities.

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \\textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \\textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \\emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations.

We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64.

In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality."}

Coupled-channels (CC) calculations were carried out in a large parameter space of quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations for the N=Z, $^{28}$Si and N=Z+2, $^{30}$Si nuclei. $^{28}$Si at the N=Z line is observed to be uniquely oblate shaped in its ground state. In contrast, for $^{30}$Si with just two additional neutrons -- oblate, prolate, and spherical CC descriptions are equally compatible with the measurements. To further investigate the nuclear structure evolution with varying neutron number, shell-model calculations were performed. These calculations reveal a sudden change in the nuclear structure aspects at $^{30}$Si in going from $^{28}$Si to $^{30}$Si. Combined reaction and structure analyses consistently indicate that $^{30}$Si does not possess a well-defined intrinsic shape, and it is a potential candidate for ``shape fluctuations\" in its ground state."}

Concretely, given a venue-specific minimum review target (e.g., 3 or 4), we use this signal to decide which papers receive one additional review (e.g., a 4th or 5th), without conditioning on any human reviews and without using LLM outputs for accept/reject.

However, the MPEM relies on strict physical assumptions regarding source symmetry and isolation, and requires optimization-based calibration that is highly sensitive to initialization. These constraints limit its applicability to systems with complex or irregular coil geometries. This work introduces an alternative modeling paradigm based on multi-layer perceptrons that learns nonlinear magnetic mappings while strictly preserving the linear dependence on currents. As a result, the field models enable fast, closed-form minimum-norm inversion with evaluation times of approximately 1 ms, which is critical for high-bandwidth magnetic control. For model training and evaluation we use large-scale, high-density datasets collected from the research-grade OctoMag and clinical-grade Navion systems. Our results demonstrate that data-driven models achieve predictive fidelity equivalent to the MPEM while maintaining comparable data efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that straightforward design choices effectively eliminate spurious workspace ill-conditioning frequently reported in MPEM-based calibration.

Works such as Wukong, HiFormer, and DHEN have attempted to increase the complexity of interaction structures in ranking models and validate scaling laws between performance and parameters/FLOPs by stacking multiple layers. However, their experimental scale remains relatively limited. Our previous work introduced the TokenMixer architecture, an efficient variant of the standard Transformer where the self-attention mechanism is replaced by a simple reshape operation, and the feed-forward network is adapted to a pertoken FFN. The effectiveness of this architecture was demonstrated in the ranking stage by the model presented in the RankMixer paper. However, this foundational TokenMixer architecture itself has several design limitations. In this paper, we propose TokenMixer-Large, which systematically addresses these core issues: sub-optimal residual design, insufficient gradient updates in deep models, incomplete MoE sparsification, and limited exploration of scalability. By leveraging a mixing-and-reverting operation, inter-layer residuals, the auxiliary loss and a novel Sparse-Pertoken MoE architecture, TokenMixer-Large successfully scales its parameters to 7-billion and 15-billion on online traffic and offline experiments, respectively.

Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community."}

The dataset, drawn from the CWTS in-house Scopus database, includes Ukrainian scholars who were internationally mobile between 2020 and 2023. The analysis focuses on scholars affiliated with universities and the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU) prior to moving abroad. The findings reveal an increase in the number of internationally mobile scholars in 2022-2023, driven primarily by rising mobility from universities. For NASU-affiliated scholars, Russia was the top destination country in 2020-2021 but fell to fourth place in 2022-2023, overtaken by Germany, China, and Poland. For university-affiliated scholars, Poland, Germany, and Russia consistently ranked as the top three destination countries across both periods. Statistical tests indicate no significant difference in mean Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FNCI) between scholars who were internationally mobile in 2020-2021 and those mobile in 2022-2023. However, the share of internationally mobile scholars with articles among the top 10% most cited globally increased among those previously affiliated with universities, while it declined among those affiliated with NASU. In both periods, the proportion of scholars with articles in the top 10% most cited globally, published during the five years prior to changing their country of affiliation, was higher among internationally mobile scholars than among those who remained affiliated with Ukrainian institutions. Whether this mobility constitutes a brain drain requires further research. If effectively leveraged, international mobility may strengthen Ukraine's integration into global scientific networks, support post-war recovery, and contribute to a more resilient, internationally connected, and competitive academic system."}

Existing methods generally adopted a two-stage \"retrieval-refinement\" strategy to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, they still suffer from (i) noisy retrieval due to skewed data distribution and (ii) lack of semantic understanding in refinement. While semantic enhancement, e.g., LLMs modeling or semantic embeddings, offers potential solutions to these two challenges, these approaches face impractical inference costs or insufficient representation granularity. Obsorbing multi-granularity and lightness merits of semantic identity (SID), we propose a novel paradigm that equips retrieval and refinement in Lifelong User Modeling with SEmantic IDs (R2LED) to address these issues. First, we introduce a Multi-route Mixed Retrieval for the retrieval stage. On the one hand, it captures users' interests from various granularities by several parallel recall routes. On the other hand, a mixed retrieval mechanism is proposed to efficiently retrieve candidates from both collaborative and semantic views, reducing noise. Then, for refinement, we design a Bi-level Fusion Refinement, including a target-aware cross-attention for route-level fusion and a gate mechanism for SID-level fusion. It can bridge the gap between semantic and collaborative spaces, exerting the merits of SID. The comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in both performance and efficiency.

The key insight is that adaptive AI-driven test execution can navigate mobile applications under degraded backend conditions, eliminating the need to manually write test cases for each combination of user flow, city, and failure type. Since Q1 2024, our system has executed over 180,000 automated chaos tests across 47 critical flows in Uber's Rider, Driver, and Eats applications, representing approximately 39,000 hours of manual testing effort that would be impractical at this scale. We identified 23 resilience risks, with 70% being architectural dependency violations where non-critical service failures degraded core user flows. Twelve issues were severe enough to prevent trip requests or food orders. Two caused application crashes detectable only through mobile chaos testing, not backend testing alone. Automated root cause analysis reduced debugging time from hours to minutes, achieving 88% precision@5 in attributing mobile failures to specific backend services.

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals."}

While prior work has refined how such distances are computed, less attention has been paid to how dyadic relations are aggregated to characterize novelty at the paper level. We address this limitation by introducing a network-based indicator, Cognitive Traversal Distance (CTD). Conceptualizing the historical literature as a weighted knowledge network, CTD is defined as the length of the shortest path required to connect all knowledge units associated with a paper. CTD provides a paper-level novelty measure that reflects the minimal structural distance needed to integrate multiple knowledge units, moving beyond mean- or quantile-based aggregation of pairwise distances. Using 27 million biomedical publications indexed by OpenAlex and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) as standardized knowledge units, we evaluate CTD against expert-based novelty benchmarks from F1000Prime-recommended papers and Nobel Prize-winning publications. CTD consistently outperforms conventional aggregation-based indicators. We further show that MeSH-based CTD is less sensitive to novelty driven by the emergence of entirely new conceptual labels, clarifying its scope relative to recent text-based measures."}

However, in realistic non-uniform urban propagation environments, it is difficult to consistently select good limited serving AP sets, resulting in significantly degraded throughput, reintroducing \"edge-effect\" for the worst-served users. To restore the uniformly good performance of scalable CF-mMIMO in realistic urban networks, we formulate a novel multi-objective optimization problem to jointly achieve high throughput by maximizing the sum data rate, uniform throughput by maximizing Jain's fairness index of the throughput per user, and scalability by minimizing the serving AP set size. We then propose the UnifSrv AP selection algorithms to solve this optimization problem, consisting of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm UnifSrv-DRL and a heuristic algorithm UnifSrv-heu. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of scalable CF-mMIMO under realistic urban network distributions, propagation, and mobility patterns, showing that the prior benchmark AP selection schemes fail to provide uniformly high throughput in practice. By contrast, UnifSrv at least doubles the throughput compared to prior benchmarks, or achieves comparable throughput but with half of the serving AP set size. Importantly, our heuristic algorithm achieves equivalent throughput to our DRL one, but with orders of magnitude lower complexity. We thus for the first time propose an AP selection algorithm that achieves uniformly good CF-mMIMO performance in realistic urban networks with low complexity."}

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures."}

Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines.

However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by \"baking in\" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for \"texture baking,\" while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control."}

We propose Cotten4Rec, a novel SR model utilizing linear-time cosine similarity attention, implemented through a single optimized compute unified device architecture (CUDA) kernel. By minimizing intermediate buffers and kernel-launch overhead, Cotten4Rec substantially reduces resource usage compared to BERT4Rec and the linear-attention baseline, LinRec, especially for datasets with moderate sequence lengths and vocabulary sizes. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets confirm that Cotten4Rec achieves considerable reductions in memory and runtime with minimal compromise in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating Cotten4Rec's viability as an efficient alternative for practical, large-scale sequential recommendation scenarios where computational resources are critical."}

Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature. Developers must reason about trajectories of LLM queries, tool calls, and code modifications, but current techniques reveal little of this intermediate process in a comprehensible format. The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools."}

They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench."}

Their random sparsity, however, is at odds with efficient implementations on modern GPUs, since it leads to irregular memory access patterns that degrade memory bandwidth utilization. Motivated by this tension, we pursue a sketch-kernel co-design approach: we design a new family of sparse sketches, BlockPerm-SJLT, whose sparsity structure is chosen to enable FlashSketch, a corresponding optimized CUDA kernel that implements these sketches efficiently. The design of BlockPerm-SJLT introduces a tunable parameter that explicitly trades off the tension between GPU-efficiency and sketching robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees for BlockPerm-SJLT under the oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) framework, and also analyze the effect of the tunable parameter on sketching quality. We empirically evaluate FlashSketch on standard RandNLA benchmarks, as well as an end-to-end ML data attribution pipeline called GraSS. FlashSketch pushes the Pareto frontier of sketching quality versus speed, across a range of regimes and tasks, and achieves a global geomean speedup of roughly 1.7x over the prior state-of-the-art GPU sketches."}

Experiments with the LLaMA-3.1-8B model on the CodeXGLUE Python dataset show that the proposed serialized ASTs reduce the length of LLM inputs, require shorter training times, and achieve summarization quality comparable to existing approaches."}

Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding."}

We present PackInfer, a kernel-level attention framework that enables compute- and I/O-aware execution for heterogeneous batched inference. PackInfer orchestrates batched requests into load-balanced execution groups, effectively saturating GPU utilization by packing multiple requests into unified kernel launches. By constructing attention kernels directly over packed query-key regions, PackInfer eliminates redundant computation and balances thread-block execution. It then incorporates I/O-aware grouping that co-locates shared-prefix requests and reorganizes KV caches into group-contiguous layouts, reducing memory fragmentation and redundant data movement as generation evolves.

Automating this process is non-trivial because the information required for effective failure management is unstructured and cannot be automatically processed by traditional programs. With their ability to process unstructured data, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for automated failure management by previous work. Following these studies, we evaluated whether an LLM-based system could automate failure management in a CI/CD pipeline in the context of a large industrial software project, namely SAP HANA. We evaluated the ability of the LLM-based system to identify the error location and to propose exact solutions that contain no unnecessary actions. To support the LLM in generating exact solutions, we provided it with different types of domain knowledge, including pipeline information, failure management instructions, and data from historical failures. We conducted an ablation study to determine which type of domain knowledge contributed most to solution accuracy. The results show that data from historical failures contributed the most to the system's accuracy, enabling it to produce exact solutions in 92.1% of cases in our dataset. The system correctly identified the error location with 97.4% accuracy when provided with domain knowledge, compared to 84.2% accuracy without it. In conclusion, our findings indicate that LLMs, when provided with data from historical failures, represent a promising approach for automating CI/CD pipeline failure management."}

However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling.

Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration.

The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation.

Developers need actionable insights that can be directly employed in software quality assurance processes and guide defect mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present a structured process for defining context-specific software metric thresholds suitable for integration into fault detection workflows in industrial settings. Our approach supports cross-project fault prediction by deriving thresholds from one set of projects and applying them to independently developed firmware, thereby enabling reuse across similar software systems without retraining or domain-specific tuning. We analyze three real-world C-embedded firmware projects provided by an industrial partner, using Coverity and Understand static analysis tools to extract software metrics. Through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we identify discriminative metrics and derived empirical threshold values capable of distinguishing faulty from non-faulty functions. The derived thresholds are validated through an experimental evaluation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying fault-prone functions with high precision. The results confirm that the derived thresholds can serve as an interpretable solution for fault prediction, aligning with industry standards and SQA practices. This approach provides a practical alternative to black-box AI models, allowing developers to systematically assess software quality, take preventive actions, and integrate metric-based fault prediction into industrial development workflows to mitigate software faults."}

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures.

Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision."}

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures."}

Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs. However, naive integration of BTs and RL can lead to some controllers counteracting other controllers, possibly undoing previously achieved subgoals, thereby degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose progress constraints, a novel mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results.

While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%. In our commodity cluster setup, FCDP achieves up to 100x higher throughput than ZeRO-3 and 51x higher than ZeRO++, while maintaining ZeRO-3's maximum batch size."}

Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent."}

To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable."}

Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work."}

In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations.

The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS.

However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines. Our distilled model achieves 91.4% parameter reduction and 3x faster inference on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios."}

However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.\n  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability."}

While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes."}

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers."}

To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT.

ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering."}

However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration.

In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL.

Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}

Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning. Guided by these findings, we propose architectural modifications that significantly improve the performance of SSM-based code model, validating that our analysis directly enables better models."}

First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance."}

Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that \"confirmation bias\" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought."}

Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. As a universal plugin, CER can be seamlessly integrated into various SOTA models to provide performance gains."}

To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework"}

While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research.

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures."}

We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.

To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol.

Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model.

However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making.

However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup.

ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses.

In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation.

As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like \"Perceive-Reflect-Adjust\" process.

Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces."}

Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks.

To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter.

This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances.

Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses \"thinking with images\" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\\times$ lower token budget."}

To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions.

However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to \"condition conflicts\" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization."}

Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature. Developers must reason about trajectories of LLM queries, tool calls, and code modifications, but current techniques reveal little of this intermediate process in a comprehensible format. The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools."}

Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m. These results demonstrated that monocular depth estimation networks trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height data provide a promising and scalable pathway for high-resolution, spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery."}

This 'pixels-to-sequence' paradigm enables the precise and holistic constraint satisfaction of complex geometries, such as slanted walls and curved arcs. To support this data-hungry approach, we introduce a scalable data engine: we construct a large-scale dataset (Floorplan-2M) and a high-fidelity subset (Floorplan-HQ-300K) to balance geometric diversity and pixel-level precision.

Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines.

To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes.

Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation."}

To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution.

Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches.

Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms."}

Furthermore, existing methods frequently suffer from \"prototype drift,\" where learned prototypes lack tangible grounding in the training distribution and change their activation under small perturbations. We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets. We evaluate ProtoQuant on ImageNet and several fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196). Our results demonstrate that ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy while generalizing to ImageNet and comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods."}

The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks.

SICA: Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation for Unified-Yet-Discriminative Artifact Feature Space Reconstruction", "comment": null, "summary": "Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative\" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis.

To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing.

An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data.

However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security."}

Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation."}

Our key contribution is a novel error criterion, derived directly from the 3DGS rendering equation, that precisely measures each Gaussian's contribution to the rendered image.

Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation."}

Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction.

We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs."}

In medical imaging, however, obtaining such datasets is particularly challenging since annotations must be provided by specialized physicians, which severely limits the pool of annotators. Furthermore, class boundaries can often be ambiguous or difficult to define which further complicates machine learning-based classification. In this paper, we want to address this problem and introduce a framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets. This is validated on the two largest, publicly available datasets for Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important imaging procedure for examining the gastrointestinal tract based on a video stream of lowresolution images. In addition, potentially mislabeled samples identified by our pipeline were reviewed and re-annotated by three experienced gastroenterologists. Our results show that the proposed framework successfully detects incorrectly labeled data and results in an improved anomaly detection performance after cleaning the datasets compared to current baselines."}

To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments."}

In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \\textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \\textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \\emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: SVRepair achieves \\textbf{36.47\\%} accuracy on SWE-Bench M, \\textbf{38.02\\%} on MMCode, and \\textbf{95.12\\%} on CodeVision, validating the effectiveness of SVRepair for multimodal program repair."}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding."}

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers."}
