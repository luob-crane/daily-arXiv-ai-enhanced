This study investigates the development and impact of BERT-family models, focusing on team size, topic specialization, and citation patterns behind the models. Using a dataset of 4,208 BERT-related papers from the Papers with Code (PWC) dataset, we analyze how the BERT-family models evolve across methodological generations and how the newness of models is correlated with their production and recognition. Our findings reveal that newer BERT models are developed by larger, more experienced, and institutionally diverse teams, reflecting the increasing complexity of AI research. Additionally, these models exhibit greater topical specialization, targeting niche applications, which aligns with broader trends in scientific specialization. However, newer models receive fewer citations, particularly over the long term, suggesting a \"first-mover advantage,\" where early models like BERT garner disproportionate recognition. These insights highlight the need for equitable evaluation frameworks that value both foundational and incremental innovations. This study underscores the evolving interplay between collaboration, specialization, and recognition in AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, efficient and controllable production of \\textsuperscript{229m}Th remains a major experimental challenge. We propose an efficient scheme to produce the $^{229\\mathrm{m}}$Th in storage rings (SRs) and electron beam ion traps (EBITs), using a cascade decay pathway. Highly charged ions are excited to higher nuclear states via nuclear excitation by inelastic electron scattering (NEIES) and nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC), followed by radiative or internal conversion cascades that populate the isomer. Our calculations demonstrate that, under typical SRs and EBITs conditions, optimized indirect excitation pathways significantly enhance \\textsuperscript{229m}Th production rate. In particular, NEIES can provide an enhancement of up to four orders of magnitude through cascade de-excitation at high energies, while NEEC can contribute an additional enhancement of up to several tens of times. Such a significant increase in the \\textsuperscript{229m}Th yield rate would facilitate its application in various nuclear photonics fields, especially in the development of atomic nuclear clocks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
