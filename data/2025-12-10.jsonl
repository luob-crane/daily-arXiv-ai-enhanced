However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests."}

Entities are classified as either counsel or non-counsel based on a predefined list of known legal professionals. The core assumption is that individuals with frequent interactions with lawyers are more likely to participate in privileged communications. To quantify this likelihood, an algorithm assigns a score to each entity within the network. By utilizing both entity scores and the strength of their connections, the method enhances the identification of privileged documents. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in ranking legal entities for privileged document detection."}

Corporations and legal teams must organize, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from large image collections under strict time pressures, making manual review impractical and costly. These demands have intensified interest in automated methods that can efficiently organize and describe large-scale image datasets. This paper presents a systematic investigation of automated cluster description generation through the integration of image clustering, image captioning, and large language models (LLMs). We apply K-means clustering to group images into 20 visually coherent clusters and generate base captions using the Azure AI Vision API. We then evaluate three critical dimensions of the cluster description process: (1) image sampling strategies, comparing random, centroid-based, stratified, hybrid, and density-based sampling against using all cluster images; (2) prompting techniques, contrasting standard prompting with chain-of-thought prompting; and (3) description generation methods, comparing LLM-based generation with traditional TF-IDF and template-based approaches. We assess description quality using semantic similarity and coverage metrics. Results show that strategic sampling with 20 images per cluster performs comparably to exhaustive inclusion while significantly reducing computational cost, with only stratified sampling showing modest degradation. LLM-based methods consistently outperform TF-IDF baselines, and standard prompts outperform chain-of-thought prompts for this task. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying scalable, accurate cluster description systems that support high-volume workflows in legal discovery and other domains requiring automated organization of large image collections."}

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks."}

While most are deployed in single node setups, CXL.mem is a technology that implements memories that can be attached to multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling shared memory pooling. This opens new possibilities, particularly for efficient inter-node communication.\n  In this paper, we present a novel performance evaluation toolchain combined with an extended performance model for message-based communication, which can be used to predict potential performance benefits from using CXL.mem for data exchange. Our approach analyzes data access patterns of MPI applications: it analyzes on-node accesses to/from MPI buffers, as well as cross-node MPI traffic to gather a full understanding of the impact of memory performance. We combine this data in an extended performance model to predict which data transfers could benefit from direct CXL.mem implementations as compared to traditional MPI messages. Our model works on a per-MPI call granularity, allowing the identification and later optimizations of those MPI invocations in the code with the highest potential for speedup by using CXL.mem.\n  For our toolchain, we extend the memory trace sampling tool Mitos and use it to extract data access behavior. In the post-processing step, the raw data is automatically analyzed to provide performance models for each individual MPI call. We validate the models on two sample applications -- a 2D heat transfer miniapp and the HPCG benchmark -- and use them to demonstrate their support for targeted optimizations by integrating CXL.mem."}

Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows."}

In this context, large language models have demonstrated strong performance. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the role of randomness in LLM-based classification for attorney-client privileged document detection, focusing on four key dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying legally privileged documents, (2) the influence of randomness control parameters on classification outputs, (3) their impact on overall classification performance, and (4) a methodology for leveraging randomness to enhance accuracy. Experimental results showed that LLMs can identify privileged documents effectively, randomness control parameters have minimal impact on classification performance, and importantly, our developed methodology for leveraging randomness can have a significant impact on improving accuracy. Notably, this methodology that leverages randomness could also enhance a corporation's confidence in an LLM's output when incorporated into its sanctions-compliance processes. As organizations increasingly rely on LLMs to augment compliance workflows, reducing output variability helps build internal and regulatory confidence in LLM-derived sanctions-screening decisions."}

Previous work developed a reduced-basis emulator for single-channel elastic scattering using an optical potential. Since many reactions of interest can be cast as a coupled-channel problem, the purpose of this work is to extend the RBM to a coupled-channel framework (CC-RBM). Although the framework derived is general, in this work we apply it to reactions where the Hamiltonian coupling term comes from assuming a rotational structure model for the target. From a set of training coupled-channel wavefunctions, we perform a singular value decomposition to obtain a reduced set of basis wavefunctions, and then solve the extended (Petrov-)Galerkin equations. In addition, the empirical interpolation method is used to expand the potentials. We apply the CC-RBM method to elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrons on 48Ca including a quadrupole coupling to populate the first 2+ state, and neutrons on 208Pb, including an octupole coupling to populate its first 3- state. We demonstrate that the CC-RBM calculated cross sections match those obtained using traditional finite-difference methods. We show that the CC-RBM results can reliably reproduce the nuclear scattering cross sections at different energy regimes. The computational accuracy versus time plots demonstrate that the CC-RBM method efficiently increases precision with increasing basis size. Most importantly, for the precisions required in reaction calculations (a percent on the cross section), we find the CC-RBM method offers roughly one and a half orders of magnitude gain in computational speed compared to the traditional coupled-channels solver. However, we also discuss how this scaling becomes less favorable, the larger the number of channels included in the coupled-channel set."}

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems."}

In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches.

Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences.

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget.

While prior work has focused primarily on kernel-level performance or single-GPU microbenchmarks, the complex interaction between communication, computation, memory behavior, and power management in multi-GPU LLM training remains poorly characterized. In this work, we introduce Chopper, a profiling and analysis framework that collects, aligns, and visualizes GPU kernel traces and hardware performance counters across multiple granularities (i.e., from individual kernels to operations, layers, phases, iterations, and GPUs). Using Chopper, we perform a comprehensive end-to-end characterization of Llama 3 8B training under fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) on an eight-GPU AMD InstinctTM MI300X node. Our analysis reveals several previously underexplored bottlenecks and behaviors, such as memory determinism enabling higher, more stable GPU and memory frequencies. We identify several sources of inefficiencies, with frequency overhead (DVFS effects) being the single largest contributor to the gap between theoretical and observed performance, exceeding the impact of MFMA utilization loss, communication/computation overlap, and kernel launch overheads. Overall, Chopper provides the first holistic, multi-granularity characterization of LLM training on AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPUs, yielding actionable insights for optimizing training frameworks, improving power-management strategies, and guiding future GPU architecture and system design."}

The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board."}

Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice.

This problem arises because users typically interact with only a small subset of available items, leading existing models to arbitrarily treat unobserved items as negative samples. To this end, we propose VI-MMRec, a model-agnostic and training cost-free framework that enriches sparse user-item interactions via similarity-aware virtual user-item interactions. These virtual interactions are constructed based on modality-specific feature similarities of user-interacted items. Specifically, VI-MMRec introduces two different strategies: (1) Overlay, which independently aggregates modality-specific similarities to preserve modality-specific user preferences, and (2) Synergistic, which holistically fuses cross-modal similarities to capture complementary user preferences. To ensure high-quality augmentation, we design a statistically informed weight allocation mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to virtual user-item interactions based on dataset-specific modality relevance. As a plug-and-play framework, VI-MMRec seamlessly integrates with existing models to enhance their performance without modifying their core architecture. Its flexibility allows it to be easily incorporated into various existing models, maximizing performance with minimal implementation effort. Moreover, VI-MMRec introduces no additional overhead during training, making it significantly advantageous for practical deployment. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets using seven state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models validate the effectiveness of our VI-MMRec."}

Our approach employs Bayesian analysis to study this phenomenon. Hadronic matter is modeled using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, for which we have selected two parameter sets: \\(NL3^{*}ωρ\\), representing hadronic matter with nucleons only, and $EL3ωρ$ with nucleons only and $EL3ωρY$, which includes hyperons. On the other hand deconfined quark matter is modeled using the vector-MIT bag model. For our purpose, the phase transition is implemented using the Maxwell construction. Bayesian inference is performed by tuning three parameters: the bag constant (i.e. $B^{1/4}$), the vector coupling constant \\(\\left(G_{v}\\right)\\), and the Dirac sea contribution ($b_{4}$). We found that a phase transition could exist at densities below \\(2.0\\,n_{0}\\) for both the $EL3ωρ- EL3ωρY $ and $NL3^{*}ωρ$ parametrizations. As a consequence, our results also indicate that a hybrid neutron star could have a large quark core that comprises more than \\(80\\%\\) of its size."}

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes."}

Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles."}

Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions.

Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%.

On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed.

This study introduces a two-stage machine learning framework that explicitly models delay-absorption behavior and incorporates it into downstream delay prediction. In Stage I, a CatBoost classifier estimates the probability that a flight successfully absorbs an upstream delay based on operational, temporal, and meteorological features. This probability, termed AbsorbScore, quantifies airport- and flight-specific resilience to delay propagation. In Stage II, an XGBoost classifier integrates AbsorbScore with schedule, weather, and congestion indicators to predict whether a flight will depart more than 15 minutes late. Using U.S. domestic flight and NOAA weather data from Summer 2023, the proposed framework achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, increasing ROC-AUC from 0.865 to 0.898 and enhancing precision to 89.2% in identifying delayed flights. The results demonstrate that modeling delay absorption as an intermediate mechanism significantly improves predictive performance and yields interpretable insights into airport recovery dynamics, offering a practical foundation for data-driven delay management and proactive operational planning."}

Investigating Package Hallucinations of Shell Command in Original and Quantized LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models for code (LLMs4Code) are increasingly used to generate software artifacts, including library and package recommendations in languages such as Go. However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation.\n  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies. Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation."}

Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA.

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions."}

However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed.\n  In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations.\n  In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings. If one wants to have a lock that works well for any library, we suggest using the cohort lock, which strikes a balance between MCS and TTAS by utilizing several MCS queues with a common TTAS."}

This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles.

Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results.

Increasing shots to 250 000 restored library-level accuracy.

We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning.

KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery."}

One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level.\n  In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data. Experimental results show that these models not only achieve significant token savings (up to 11.2% reduction) during generation but also maintain near-identical Pass@1 scores compared to baselines trained on unprocessed code."}

Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\\ low vs.\\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\\%/19.8\\%/39.2\\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust. These results indicate that a simple random masking schedule, coupled with consistency and entropy objectives, is sufficient to drive effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals."}

Temporal shifting also decreases the footprint, though to a lesser extent.

This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow."}

Traditional cloud-based tools offer strong reasoning but risk data exposure and latency, while on-device solutions lack full-context understanding across codebase and developer tooling. We introduce SolidGPT, an open-source, edge-cloud hybrid developer assistant built on GitHub, designed to enhance code and workspace semantic search. SolidGPT enables developers to: talk to your codebase: interactively query code and project structure, discovering the right methods and modules without manual searching. Automate software project workflows: generate PRDs, task breakdowns, Kanban boards, and even scaffold web app beginnings, with deep integration via VSCode and Notion. Configure private, extensible agents: onboard private code folders (up to approximately 500 files), connect Notion, customize AI agent personas via embedding and in-context training, and deploy via Docker, CLI, or VSCode extension. In practice, SolidGPT empowers developer productivity through: Semantic-rich code navigation: no more hunting through files or wondering where a feature lives. Integrated documentation and task management: seamlessly sync generated PRD content and task boards into developer workflows. Privacy-first design: running locally via Docker or VSCode, with full control over code and data, while optionally reaching out to LLM APIs as needed. By combining interactive code querying, automated project scaffolding, and human-AI collaboration, SolidGPT provides a practical, privacy-respecting edge assistant that accelerates real-world development workflows, ideal for intelligent mobile and software engineering contexts."}

Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks."}

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties."}

A key limitation in existing research is the failure to distinguish between agreement with the abstract, high-level values of the Agile Manifesto and agreement with the concrete, day-to-day practices derived from the 12 Principles. This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument.\n  We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals. These scales represent a critical initial step toward facilitating a more nuanced measurement of agile agreement, distinguishing agile agreement across various levels of perception and aiding in a more refined interpretation of person-agile fit."}

To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems."}

It seamlessly enables the optimization of the steady-states pair that is not unique due to the MISO nature of the model. Anesthesia dynamics is a multi-time scale system with two types of states characterized, respectively, by fast and slow dynamics. In anesthesia control, the output equation depends only on the fast dynamics. Therefore, the slow states can be treated as disturbances, and compensation terms can be introduced. Subsequently, the system can be reformulated as a nominal one allowing the design of an MPC for tracking strategy. The presented framework ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability, through the design of appropriate terminal ingredients in the MPC for tracking framework. The controller performance is then assessed on a patient in a simulation environment."}

Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories."}

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy."}

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests.

Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks.

Based on this insight, explicit analytical conditions on the quantization gain and the security parameter are derived to prevent overflow in computing over encrypted data. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a quantitative relationship between quantization-induced errors and the deviation between the gains obtained by CFRIT and non-confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT), clarifying how parameter choice affects tuning accuracy.

Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback.

Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \\textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \\textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \\textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \\num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook.

This strategy consists in letting the epidemics spread without intervention until the threshold is reached, then applying the minimum control that leaves the fraction of infected individuals constantly at the threshold until the reproduction number becomes less than one and the infection naturally fades out. Our result generalizes one available in the literature for the equivalent problem formulated for the classical SIR model, which can be recovered as a special case of our model when the infection rate is constant. Our contribution enhances the understanding of epidemic management with adaptive human behavior, offering insights for robust containment strategies."}

Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity. We further enhance visual quality through hierarchical feature fusion, incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors extracted from parametric SMPL models to simultaneously improve global coherence and local detail accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Blur2Sharp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in both novel pose and view generation tasks, particularly excelling under challenging scenarios involving loose clothing and occlusions."}

The method involves the construction of a specific class of time-invariant CBFs that encode the system's dynamic capabilities with respect to a given constraint, and augments them subsequently with appropriately designed time-dependent transformations. While transformations uniformly varying the time-invariant CBF can be applied to arbitrary systems, transformations exploiting structural properties in the dynamics - equivariances in particular - enable the handling of a broader and more expressive class of time-varying constraints. The article shows how to leverage such properties in the design of time-varying CBFs. The proposed method decouples the design of time variations from the computationally expensive construction of the underlying CBFs, thereby providing a computationally attractive method to the design of time-varying CBFs. The method accounts for input constraints and under-actuation, and requires only qualitative knowledge on the time-variation of the constraints making it suitable to the application in uncertain environments."}

Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation.

These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline.

Using temporal measurement features and matching them with radio maps, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse impact of multipath propagation and reduces the dependence on LoS paths.

Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs.

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.\n  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.\n  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science."}

Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents."}

In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front.

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world."}

IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance.

LaMoSys3.5D composes heterogeneous 3DDRAM chiplets on a 2.5D interposer: computerich chiplets for prefill and bandwidthcapacityrich chiplets for decode. To realize efficient serving, we adopt a hardwaresoftware codesign spanning dataflow, parallel mapping, and introduce a thermalaware modeling and hierarchical designspace exploration framework. Across diverse LLMs and workloads, LaMoSys3.5D improves throughputperwatt over DGXA100 systems by 62 and achieves a 4.87 better endtoend latency geomean versus prior 3D designs. We further distill intriguing design guidelines for 3.5DIC architectures and endtoend inference serving."}

RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior."}

This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is \"Fast by Algorithm\", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4).

Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio.

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error."}

Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference.

To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg."}

Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result.

To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos."}

Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline.

Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence."}

A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges.

However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow.

Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations.

We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification."}

For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model.

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems."}

Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance.

Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce \"thin descriptions\", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing \"thick descriptions\".

Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models."}

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests."}

Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes."}

Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows."}

The model uses DINOv3 to extract within-slice structural representations, and a separate slice-attention module to fuse contextual information across neighboring slices. A multi-scale generation decoder then restores fine-grained functional contrast, while a DINO-based perceptual loss encourages structural and textural consistency between predictions and ground-truth BOLD in the transformer feature space. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects show that DINO-BOLDNet surpasses a conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM.

By treating repository synthesis as a channel optimization problem, DeepCode seamlessly orchestrates four information operations to maximize task-relevant signals under finite context budgets: source compression via blueprint distillation, structured indexing using stateful code memory, conditional knowledge injection via retrieval-augmented generation, and closed-loop error correction. Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics.

To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame."}

This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models.

However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model."}

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes."}

Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression."}

Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions.

Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%.

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world."}

We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio.

In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU."}

Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation.

Preprint version", "summary": "Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios."}

Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost."}

Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

Automate software project workflows: generate PRDs, task breakdowns, Kanban boards, and even scaffold web app beginnings, with deep integration via VSCode and Notion. Configure private, extensible agents: onboard private code folders (up to approximately 500 files), connect Notion, customize AI agent personas via embedding and in-context training, and deploy via Docker, CLI, or VSCode extension.

We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures. To support training and evaluation, we construct a dedicated dataset by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets, rendering under multiple RGB camera sensitivities.

A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges.

While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications."}

Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries."}

This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences."}

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems."}

Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction."}

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option."}

Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings. This approach enables real-time alignment assessment during generation, reducing costs without sacrificing semantic fidelity."}

We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues.

We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones.

To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster.

The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training."}

This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time.

We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported."}

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option."}

We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues.

In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding.

Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization.

Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model."}

We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples.

However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency.

We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations.

Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay."}

To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%).

Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks."}

Recent image-to-3D generators recover reasonable geometry from single views, but their object-centric training limits generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. We present EvoScene, a self-evolving, training-free framework that progressively reconstructs complete 3D scenes from single images. The key idea is combining the complementary strengths of existing models: geometric reasoning from 3D generation models and visual knowledge from video generation models. Through three iterative stages--Spatial Prior Initialization, Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and Spatial-guided Novel View Generation--EvoScene alternates between 2D and 3D domains, gradually improving both structure and appearance. Experiments on diverse scenes demonstrate that EvoScene achieves superior geometric stability, view-consistent textures, and unseen-region completion compared to strong baselines, producing ready-to-use 3D meshes for practical applications."}

Project page: https://simondemoreau.github.io/LiDAS/", "summary": "Nighttime environments pose significant challenges for camera-based perception, as existing methods passively rely on the scene lighting. We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception."}

While diffusion models provide strong gen- erative priors for general image restoration, they often pro- duce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the ab- sence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that in- tegrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an it- erative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermedi- ate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine- grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations. Experiments on the SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks demonstrate that UniT faithfully reconstructs degraded text, substantially reduces hallucinations, and achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance in TAIR task."}

This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.

Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning."}

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models."}
