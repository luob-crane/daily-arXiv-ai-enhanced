While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete, equating provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities across the entire edge-to-core spectrum. This paper investigates six common paradigms, from the often-cited constraints of network latency and TCP congestion control algorithms to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster. This approach effectively closes the fidelity gap between benchmark results and diverse and complex production environments."}

Consequently, we showcase a range of optimizations that target these bottlenecks, including activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives.

Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.\n  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\\times$ ($15.4\\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU.

However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed."}

Submitted to 'Logical and Symbolic Reasoning in Language Models @ AAAI 2026' conference and is under review", "summary": "Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems."}

This study evaluates the technical potential of heavy-duty EV fleets to support the California power grid under three practical charging strategies: immediate charging, delayed charging, and constant-minimum-power charging. We develop a simulation framework that couples aggregated frequency dynamics with battery and charger constraints, state-of-charge management, and fleet-availability profiles. Performance is assessed using standard frequency security metrics, including nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, overshoot, and settling time, across credible contingency scenarios and renewable generation conditions. Results indicate that both non-V2G modes and V2G-enabled operation can contribute meaningful primary response, with V2G providing the strongest and fastest support while respecting mobility and network limits. Sensitivity analyses show that the relative benefits depend on charging strategy, control parameters, and renewable output, highlighting design trade-offs between response magnitude, duration, and battery usage. Overall, heavy-duty EV fleets-when coordinated by appropriate charging and V2G controls-offer a viable resource for strengthening primary frequency control on the California grid and mitigating stability challenges associated with increasing renewable penetration."}

This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the \"Something Completely Different\" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collected unbiased data, integrated into downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement, validating its value for recommender systems."}

An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts."}

We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD."}

However, there has been a lack of research on proton-rich nuclei. $^{22}$O, the mirror nucleus of $^{22}$Si, is a double-magic nucleus bearing a high $E(2_1^+)$. Whether $^{22}$Si exhibits double-magic characters is an intriguing topic. To investigate this matter, we utilized \\textit{ab initio} valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group for $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O, and their nearby nuclei. Our \\textit{ab initio} calculations provide good descriptions for the double magicity of $^{22}$O, as well as the shell evolution of $N=14$ and $Z=14$ through $E(2_1^+)$. The computed $E(2_1^+)$ indicate that the closure of $Z=14$ sub-shell in proton-rich nuclei is weaker than the $N=14$ sub-shell closure in their mirror nuclei. Particularly, the calculated $E(2_1^+)$ of $^{22}$Si is 800 keV lower than the one of $^{22}$O. To further explore the magicity of $^{22}$Si, the mirror energy difference (MED) of $^{26}$Si/$^{26}$Mg, $^{24}$Si/$^{24}$Ne, as well as $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O are calculated. The results demonstrate that the calculated MEDs agree well with available experimental data, and the $E(2_1^+)$ values of $^{22,24,26}$Si are all lower than their respective mirror nuclei due to the Thomas-Ehrman shift with large $s_{1/2}$ occupation. Moreover, our calculation provides that the many-body configurations of the low-lying state of $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O are nearly identical despite the fact that the states bearing large MED. In conclusion, our \\textit{ab initio} results suggest that $^{22}$Si is a double magic nucleus, similar to its mirror nucleus $^{22}$O, albeit with a lower $E(2_1^+)$."}

However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model."}

Momentum correlations between the decay products indicate that it is not a sequential 2p decay through a 7Be intermediate state, but indicative of prompt 2p emission with correlations similar to those of the other members of the triplet. Ab initio calculations with the symmetry-adapted nocore shell model indicate that these three states have very similar spatial wavefunctions, but with nucleons coupling to different spins, isospins, and isospin projections.

We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings."}

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup.

Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned).

Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a \"Correctness-Congruence Gap\" where LLMs can become proficient \"coders\" but remain limited \"architects\" in fulfilling nuanced user intent."}

The investor trades a risk-free asset and several risky assets whose drifts and volatilities depend on an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type LRR factor. Preferences are described by EZ utility with risk aversion $R$, elasticity of intertemporal substitution $ψ$, and discount rate $δ$, so that the standard time-additive CRRA case appears as a limiting benchmark.\n  To handle the high-dimensional consumption--investment problem, I use a projected Pontryagin-guided deep policy optimization (P-PGDPO) scheme adapted to EZ preferences. The method starts from the continuous-time Hamiltonian implied by the Pontryagin maximum principle, represents the value and costate processes with neural networks, and updates the policy along the Hamiltonian gradient. Portfolio constraints and a lower bound on wealth are enforced by explicit projection operators rather than by adding ad hoc penalties.\n  Three main findings emerge from numerical experiments in a five-asset LRR economy: \\textbf{(1)} the P-PGDPO algorithm achieves stable convergence across multiple random seeds, validating its reliability for solving high-dimensional EZ problems; \\textbf{(2)} wealth floors materially reduce hedging demand by limiting the investor's ability to exploit intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs; and \\textbf{(3)} the learned hedging portfolios concentrate exposure in assets with high correlation to the LRR factor, confirming that EZ agents actively hedge long-run uncertainty rather than merely following myopic rules. Because EZ preferences nest time-additive CRRA in the limit $ψ\\to 1/R$, I use CRRA as an explicit diagnostic benchmark and, when needed, a warm start to stabilize training in high dimensions."}

Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs.

Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process.

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models."}

This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0.

Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms.

Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving.

We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success.

Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting.

Considering the possibility that strategic drivers misreport their charging preferences to the station coordinator, we then propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism that incentivizes truthful reporting. We conclude with a simulated case study using real-world data to quantitatively assess the added value of drivers' temporal flexibility for enhancing vehicle-to-grid services and reducing station congestion."}

This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices."}

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks."}

Existing approaches often decouple these two states, lack stability guarantees, and exhibit limited generalization across operating conditions. This study introduces a unified operator-theoretic framework for aging-aware state of charge and control-informed state of health estimation. The architecture couples a Koopman-based latent dynamics model, which enables linear forecasting of nonlinear discharge-capacity evolution under varying operational conditions, with a neural operator that maps measurable intra-cycle signals to state of charge. The predicted discharge capacity is incorporated as a static correction within the neural operator pathway, yielding an age-aware state of charge estimate. Stability is ensured through spectral-radius clipping of the Koopman operator. The overall framework is trained end-to-end and evaluated on real-world lithium-ion battery datasets, demonstrating real-time capability while maintaining stable dynamics. To handle condition shifts and unseen regimes, the method integrates both zero-shot and few-shot out-of-distribution adaptation using only a limited number of cycles. Results show accurate and stable capacity forecasts, competitive state of charge trajectories on held-out cycles, and a direct, model-consistent mechanism for tracking capacity fade as a surrogate for state of health across diverse operating conditions."}

We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring."}

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline."}

An Economic Model Predictive Controller is proposed, centralizing the decision making and achieving the theoretical optimal operation. Different scenarios with changing climate conditions are presented, and a comparison with the typical, non-optimized industrial process operation is established.

Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate.

While a wide range of flexible resources-including electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-have demonstrated the physical capability to provide fast frequency response (FFR), existing studies primarily focus on individual resource performance or controller-level designs. A systematic framework that translates heterogeneous FFR capabilities into deployable, system-level frequency services remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a service-oriented coordination framework for fast frequency response from flexible loads and energy storage, bridging the gap between physical capability assessment and grid-operational utilization. The framework decomposes frequency support into multiple time-critical service layers based on response speed, power capacity, and energy sustainability, and dynamically allocates FFR responsibilities among heterogeneous resources accordingly. By explicitly accounting for response latency, saturation limits, and energy constraints, the proposed approach enables coordinated dispatch that prioritizes ultra-fast resources for initial frequency arrest while leveraging slower but energy-rich resources to sustain recovery."}

According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load."}

The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points.

The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions.

These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors.

Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data.

Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy."}

To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires.

PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs."}

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types. We illustrate the approach using air quality use case and validate its performance using different test cases from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks."}

Camera-ready for WACV 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image."}

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware."}

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included.

Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments.

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery.

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments."}

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty."}

Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of \"usefulness\", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes."}

Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations.

Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking."}

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques."}

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%."}

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications."}

We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent).

Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation.

We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success.

Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices."}

Frameworks for \"thinking with images\" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding."}

To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales.

According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure.

Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets.

While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image."}

However, most existing methods for RAW-based low-light enhancement usually sequentially process multi-scale information, which makes it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds. Besides, they usually ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, and fail to achieve better reconstruction performance with good use of green channel information. In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency.

We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware."}

Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues.

Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments."}

To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks.

In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity.

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems."}

SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision.

However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data.

Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection.

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem."}

The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs."}

Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework."}

This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios.

However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem."}

Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters.

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results."}

Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively.

The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development.

The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion.

To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data.

While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes."}

To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals.

In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation.

In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach."}

We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts.

However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets."}

IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration.

A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations.

Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT).

Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented."}

OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy.

They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance.

However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation.

A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality."}

However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%.

However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs."}

To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training."}

Ramirez", "Yuchen Wang", "David J. Crandall"], "title": "GateFusion: Hierarchical Gated Cross-Modal Fusion for Active Speaker Detection", "comment": "accepted by WACV 2026", "summary": "Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component."}

They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models."}

However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL."}

Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed \"Pixio\", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches."}

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems."}
