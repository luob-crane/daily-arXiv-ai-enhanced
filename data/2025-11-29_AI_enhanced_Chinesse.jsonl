Findings highlight that open access (OA) articles constituted the majority of publications by Ukrainian scholars during this period. This percentage reached 75.4% for NASU and 85.8% for universities. In both cases, the increase was driven by Gold OA and Hybrid Gold OA, the latter benefiting in part from Elsevier's waivers. Diamond OA prevailed for NASU, while Gold OA was dominant for universities. The effects of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine included (1) a decline in the share of articles in foreign journals for both NASU and universities, (2) a decrease in Gold OA in foreign journals and an increase in Gold OA in Ukrainian journals for universities, and (3) a rise in internationally co-authored Gold OA articles in foreign journals for both entities. Despite waivers for Gold OA provided by major publishers and an increase in Gold OA articles in Elsevier and Springer journals, MDPI and Aluna Publishing House remained the dominant publishers of Gold OA in foreign journals. Hybrid Gold OA, Bronze OA, and Green OA articles in foreign journals had the highest citation impact. The citation impact of Gold OA outperformed Diamond OA.

Therefore, we construct a theory uncertainty model at the partial wave amplitude level, allowing us to generate a sophisticated theory covariance matrix that captures the way the theory error structure changes as energy increases. We then perform a Bayesian analysis and simultaneously estimate the joint posterior distributions of the effective range theory parameters and the parameters that characterize the effective field theory truncation uncertainty. We compare two different analyses: no $f$-wave interactions for data up to $E_{\\text{max}} = 2.6$ MeV, and including $f$-wave interactions for data up to $E_{\\text{max}} = 5.5$ MeV.

However, determining the dissipativity of a system is an involved and, often, model-specific process. We present a general method to determine the local dissipativity properties of nonlinear, control affine systems. We simultaneously search for the optimal IO characterization of a system and synthesize a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) storage function via a convex optimization problem. To do so, we reformulate the relationship between the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality and the dissipation inequality as an linear matrix inequality (LMI) and develop novel LMI bounds for a triangulation.

In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a \"universally effective\" GEO strategy.

This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime.

We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module).

While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \\textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.

However, in recent years, there has been a significant surge in retractions, driven largely by the proliferation of low-quality and fraudulent papers. This study aims to examine retractions and their evolving trends through a topic lens. Our analysis of global retraction data reveals that the numbers of retraction have remained alarmingly high in recent years, with the growth rate of retracted papers significantly outpacing that of overall global publications. While retractions are observed across various fields, their distribution is not uniform. In disciplines characterized by high retraction rates, certain topics may only encounter minor issues, whereas in fields with lower retraction rates, some topics can experience substantial challenges.

In heavy nuclei, this balance is expected to be achieved at lower energies than in protons, making lead-lead collisions at the LHC an ideal environment to probe the onset of saturation. The diffractive photoproduction of the $J/\u03c8$ vector meson provides an excellent tool to study this regime since it directly probes the gluon distribution in the target. ALICE offers unique kinematic coverage of the photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy, spanning from 20 to 800 GeV, corresponding to three orders of magnitude in Bjorken-$x$ from about $10^{-2}$ down to $10^{-5}$. This contribution presents the latest ALICE results on the energy dependence of coherent $J/\u03c8$ production, which is sensitive to the average gluon density, and on the energy and Mandelstam-$t$ dependence of incoherent production, which probes fluctuations of the gluon field at different spatial scales.

Due to the spatial arrangement of transmitter (Tx) coils embedded into the ER pavement, the power drawn by the EV's receiver (Rx) coil is oscillatory in nature. Therefore, understanding the dynamic behavior of the total DWPT load is important for power system dynamic studies. To this end, we model the load of individual EVs in the time and frequency domains for constant EV speed. We establish that a nonlinear control scheme implemented in existing DWPT-enabled EVs exhibits milder frequency harmonics compared to its linear alternative. According to this model, the harmonics of an EV load decrease in amplitude with the Rx coil length. We further propose and analyze stochastic models for the total DWPT load served by an ER segment. Our models explain how the EV composition on the ER affects its frequency spectrum. Interestingly, we show that serving more EVs with longer Rx coils (trucks) does not necessarily entail milder harmonics.

To address the challenges posed by complex medical terminology and diverse types of questions in EHRs, we propose TQGen-EHRQuery, a framework comprising a medical knowledge module and a questions template matching module. For processing medical text, we introduced the concept of a toolset, which encapsulates the text processing module as a callable tool, thereby improving processing efficiency and flexibility. We conducted extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our dataset and workflow, demonstrating their potential to enhance information querying in EHR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86TQGen\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cTQGen-EHRQuery\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u7597\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u677f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u533b\u5b66\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u590d\u6742\u8868\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u672f\u8bed\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTQGen-EHRQuery\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u533b\u7597\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u677f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5c01\u88c5\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aEHR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3EHR\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u4fe1\u606f\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using a massive dataset of over 15 million publications spanning 1970-2010 and covering six major domains (Humanities, Social Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, Engineering and Technology, and Natural Sciences), this study tracks how three core features of scientific papers - authorship team size, the breadth and variety of cited sources, and eventual citation impact - have co-evolved over time. We uncover striking differences across disciplines. In every field, papers that build on a broader and more diverse knowledge base consistently attract more citations later on, lending large-scale empirical support to theories that view scientific breakthroughs as outcomes of novel recombination across distant ideas. Bigger teams, on average, generate work with greater ultimate influence, but the gains taper off after a certain scale; very large consortia seldom produce the absolute highest-impact papers. While the Humanities and Social Sciences remain anchored in solo or small-group authorship traditions, the Natural Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering have moved decisively toward big-team mega-science. These patterns illuminate the underlying production technology of discovery, reveal discipline-specific barriers to collaboration and idea integration, and offer evidence-based guidance for research funding agencies, universities, and policymakers seeking to organize scientific work for maximum breakthrough potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e861970-2010\u5e74\u95f41500\u4e07\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d1\u751f\u91cd\u5927\u8f6c\u53d8\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5f15\u6587\u6765\u6e90\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u590d\u6742\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u56e2\u961f\u5e73\u5747\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u66f4\u5927\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fc7\u53bb40\u5e74\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f15\u6587\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8986\u76d61970-2010\u5e74\u76841500\u4e07\u7bc7\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u5927\u9886\u57df\uff08\u4eba\u6587\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f15\u6587\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u5f15\u7528\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u56e2\u961f\u5e73\u5747\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u76ca\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u4eba\u6587\u793e\u79d1\u4fdd\u6301\u5c0f\u56e2\u961f\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5df2\u8f6c\u5411\u5927\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u79d1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u601d\u60f3\u6574\u5408\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u52a9\u673a\u6784\u3001\u5927\u5b66\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7a81\u7834\u6f5c\u529b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u79d1\u7814\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

The proposed method augments the classical perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm with an adaptive gradient descent mechanism that dynamically scales the perturbation step size based on the instantaneous power-voltage slope, thereby minimizing tracking time and steady-state oscillations. An optional initialization routine enhances global MPP (GMPP) tracking under PSC. Extensive simulations, including irradiance recordings from freely moving rodent subjects relevant to the targeted application, and tests across varying converter topologies and temperatures, demonstrate its robust, topology-independent performance. The proposed algorithm achieves 99.94 percent MPPT efficiency under standard test conditions (STC), 99.21 percent when applied to experimental data, and more than 99.6 percent for the tested temperature profiles. Under PSC, the initialization routine improves tracking efficiency by up to 7.8 percent. A normalized gate-level complexity analysis and a unified figure-of-merit (FoM) incorporating efficiency, tracking time, and computational cost demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 35 state-of-the-art P&O-based MPPT algorithms.

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aragog\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Agentic\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "Agentic\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u7f6e\u5f88\u5feb\u53d8\u5f97\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "Aragog\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff1a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8def\u7531\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u6bcf\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0cAragog\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u8bf7\u6c42\u7387\u4e0b\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u670d\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8650.0-217.0%\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8632.5-78.9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6700\u6602\u8d35\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Aragog\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u914d\u7f6e\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Agentic\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Liu"], "title": "Lightweight Model Editing for LLMs to Correct Deprecated API Recommendations", "comment": null, "summary": "Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5e94\u752810\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u6765\u66f4\u65b0LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\"\u901a\u7528API\u5c42\"\u548c\"\u7279\u5b9aAPI\u5c42\"\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u8f91\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u5df2\u5f03\u7528\u7684API\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u800c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u65f6API\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EDAPIBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b8\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cPython\u5e93\u768470\u591a\u4e2a\u8fc7\u65f6API\u548c3000\u591a\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u5e94\u752810\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faAdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u901a\u7528API\u5c42\u548c\u7279\u5b9aAPI\u5c42\u6765\u9650\u5236\u7f16\u8f91\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5AdaLoRA\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u7684API\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002AdaLoRA-L\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u65b0LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6API\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%.

Klein"], "title": "Exploring Hidden Geographic Disparities in Android Apps", "comment": null, "summary": "While mobile app evolution has been widely studied, geographical variation in app behavior remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.\n  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality.

We use PMU data recorded from a real 0.15 Hz oscillation event in Denmark for post-event analysis. To this end, the EDMD algorithm processed only voltage and current phasors from nineteen PMUs at different voltage levels across the Danish grid. In such a blind-test setting with no supplementary system information, EDMD accurately pinpointed the location of the main contributor to the 0.2 Hz oscillation, consistent with the location of the problematic IBR plant later confirmed by Energinet, where the underlying cause was a control system issue. Conventional approaches, such as the dissipating energy flow (DEF) method used in the ISO-NE OSL tool did not clearly identify this plant. This joint validation with Energinet, reinforcing earlier studies using simulated IBR-dominated systems and real PMU data from ISO-NE, highlights the potential of EDMD-based post-event analysis for identifying major oscillation contributors and enabling targeted SSO mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3(EDMD)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u632f\u8361\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e39\u9ea6\u5b9e\u96450.15Hz\u632f\u8361\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684PMU\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ec5\u5904\u740619\u4e2aPMU\u7684\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u76f8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u76f2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cEDMD\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e860.2Hz\u632f\u8361\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u6e90\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ISO-NE OSL\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8017\u6563\u80fd\u6d41(DEF)\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6e05\u6670\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u7535\u5382\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3(EDMD)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8ePMU\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u76f8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u76f2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "EDMD\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e860.2Hz\u632f\u8361\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u6e90\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e0eEnerginet\u540e\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u7684\u95ee\u9898IBR\u7535\u5382\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0eEnerginet\u7684\u8054\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86EDMD\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u632f\u8361\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss.

Despite the advancements in the technical characteristics of these tools, little is known about how developers mentally model them and how mismatches affect trust, control, and adoption. We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \\textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues.

This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u9760\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5747\u503c-\u65b9\u5dee\u56e2\u961f\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u6570\u5df2\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u72ec\u7acb\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5747\u503c-\u65b9\u5dee\u56e2\u961f\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u5df2\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u72ec\u7acb\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-4.1\u548cClaude Sonnet 4\u7684Copilot\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u6587\u4ef6\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u547d\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6267\u884c\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30Copilot\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6587\u4ef6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u4ea7\u751f\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08\u4ece7.25%\u63d0\u5347\u523067.14%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u5757\u5706\u5224\u636e\u4e58\u5b50\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u6247\u533a\u6709\u754c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e92\u8054\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7ea6\u675f\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b8c\u6574\u5757\u5706\u5224\u636e\u4e58\u5b50\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u975e\u91cd\u590d\u6247\u533a\u6709\u754c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4e0d\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u539f\u59cb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u53ef\u6570\u65e0\u9650\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5173\u952e\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1a\u975e\u91cd\u590d\u6247\u533a\u6709\u754c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u96c6\u5408\u7b49\u4e8e\u9002\u5f53\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5bf9\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u65b0\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u77e9\u9635\u5171\u6b63\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u5c0f\uff08\u22644\uff09\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u5757\u5706\u5224\u636e\u4e58\u5b50\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput.

This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X.

This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u9762\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6c34\u5e73\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u6570\uff09\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u6c34\u5e73\u6216\u5782\u76f4\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6ce2\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u5f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u9762\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u914d\u7f6e\u8868\u793a\u4e3a(H,V)\u70b9\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1DIAGONALSCALE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u9762\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u548c\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6269\u5c55\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6c34\u5e73\u6216\u5782\u76f4\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06p95\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e40%\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e37%\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c112-5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u591a\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This paper presents a response-based frequency stability assessment method that uses disturbance power, inferred from generator electrical responses, to provide a unified treatment of multi-scale disturbances. Unanticipated disturbances are first classified into short-term and permanent events; permanent disturbances are further divided into step, second-level slope and minute-level slope disturbances. Based on the measured power responses of generator groups, a unified disturbance-power model is constructed to identify the disturbance type online and to quantify disturbance intensity through the disturbance power and its rate of change. Analytical frequency-response models are then derived for each disturbance class. For step disturbances, the maximum tolerable disturbance power is obtained under steady-state and transient frequency deviation constraints, and a safety-margin index is defined. For slope-type disturbances, an improved system frequency response (SFR) model and the rotor motion equation after exhaustion of primary frequency regulation are used to compute the over-limit time of frequency deviation. The proposed response-based assessment method is validated on the CSEE-FS frequency-stability benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy for quantitative frequency stability assessment in high-renewable power systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7535\u6c14\u54cd\u5e94\u63a8\u65ad\u6270\u52a8\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u529f\u529f\u7387\u6270\u52a8\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f4\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u672a\u9884\u671f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7ec4\u7684\u5b9e\u6d4b\u529f\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6270\u52a8\u529f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u6270\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u7c7b\u6270\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u89e3\u6790\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u9636\u8dc3\u6270\u52a8\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6270\u52a8\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u659c\u5761\u578b\u6270\u52a8\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9891\u7387\u504f\u5dee\u8d85\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728CSEE-FS\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7167\u660e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u533a\u548cNLOS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u8282\u80fd53.59%\uff0cSNR\u5747\u5300\u6027\u63d0\u534757.79%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5ba4\u5185\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89c9\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5c06\u8282\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5212\u5206\u63a5\u6536\u5e73\u9762\u4e3a\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u548c\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eNLOS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u6700\u5927\u5316SNR\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b053.59%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\uff0cSNR\u5747\u5300\u6027\u63d0\u534757.79%\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u7167\u660e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.071\u7c73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ISCI\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Numerical validation demonstrates effective density control, with the system achieving target distributions while maintaining robustness to disturbances and measurement noise, confirming that learning-based sparse control can replace computationally expensive online optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u95f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6570\u53d7\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u53d7\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6570\u53d7\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u53d7\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u53d7\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u63cf\u8ff0\u672a\u53d7\u63a7\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8865\u507f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u7a00\u758f\u9a71\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528FMCW\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u540c\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u591a\u4eba\u751f\u7406\u4f53\u5f81\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u76d1\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7FPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7406\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u9002\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u56f0\u96be\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u611f\u67d3\u4f20\u64ad\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u751f\u7406\u76d1\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2(FMCW)\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eFPGA\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u751f\u7406\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002FPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb2.7\u500d\uff0c\u67e5\u627e\u8868(LUT)\u5229\u7528\u7387\u964d\u4f4e18.4%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8fc77400\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u591a\u4eba\u751f\u7406\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FPGA\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u533b\u7597\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A modified IEEE 39-bus system is evaluated with GFM and GFL units equipped with low-voltage ride-through logic, current limiting, and positive- or negative-sequence prioritization. Distance protection is implemented with a mho characteristic, while line differential protection uses an alpha-plane approach. Results show that phase-to-ground loops in distance protection can substantially overestimate the fault location near the Zone-1 reach. For line differential protection, external faults may cause the operating point to briefly enter the trip region of the alpha-plane, even for the healthy-phase in ABG faults under GFL control and during the initial moments of the fault, demanding strong external security measures. These findings highlight that modern converter controls, together with current limitation and sequence-current prioritization, can compromise the reliability and security of traditional protection schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u7f51\u5f62\u6210(GFM)\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u8ddf\u968f(GFL)\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90(IBRs)\u5728\u7ebf\u8def\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u5dee\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u7535\u6d41\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5e8f\u7535\u6d41\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3GFM\u548cGFL\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8f93\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684IEEE 39\u603b\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u538b\u7a7f\u8d8a\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u7535\u6d41\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6b63\u5e8f\u6216\u8d1f\u5e8f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684GFM\u548cGFL\u5355\u5143\u3002\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u62a4\u91c7\u7528mho\u7279\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7ebf\u8def\u5dee\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u91c7\u7528alpha-plane\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5730\u56de\u8def\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30Zone-1\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u8def\u5dee\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u6545\u969c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\u77ed\u6682\u8fdb\u5165alpha-plane\u7684\u8df3\u95f8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728GFL\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7684ABG\u6545\u969c\u5065\u5eb7\u76f8\u548c\u6545\u969c\u521d\u59cb\u65f6\u523b\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u6d41\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5e8f\u7535\u6d41\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u53d6\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, integrating a high-level target assignment rule, where each herder is paired with a selected target, with a learning-based low-level driving module that enables effective steering of the assigned target. The low-level policy is trained in a one-herder-one-target scenario with a rectangular obstacle using Proximal Policy Optimization and then directly extended to multi-agent settings with multiple obstacles without requiring retraining.

Contrary to existing approaches, that assume perfect information or use heuristic maneuver models in stochastic settings, we formulate the problem in an inherently stochastic framework involving imperfect information and bounded controls. Complying with the generalized separation theorem, the control law factors in the posterior distribution of the state. Extending the well-known optimality of bang-bang evasion maneuvers in deterministic settings to the realm of realistic, stochastic evasion scenarios, we firstly prove that an optimal evasion strategy always exists, and that the set of optimal solutions includes at least one bang-bang policy, rendering the resulting optimal control problem finite-dimensional. Leveraging this structure, we secondly propose the closed-loop terminal-set-based evasion (TSE) strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation against a proportional navigation pursuer. Monte Carlo simulations show that the TSE strategy outperforms traditional stochastic evasion strategies based on random telegraph, Singer, and weaving models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u7ec8\u7aef\u5bf9\u6297\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6297\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u5236\u5bfc\u7684\u5bfc\u5f39\u3002\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6709\u9650\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec8\u7aef\u96c6\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u673a\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6709\u9650\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684bang-bang\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u907f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u907f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u79bb\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2abang-bang\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u3002\u5176\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec8\u7aef\u96c6\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5bfc\u822a\u8ffd\u51fb\u8005\uff0cTSE\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u3001Singer\u548c\u7f16\u7ec7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06bang-bang\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u907f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u968f\u673a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TSE\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5bf9\u6297\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u907f\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Only some general assumptions about the process, in this work type-one stable behavior, can be available for engineers, in particular in motion control systems. This paper proposes a practical and simple in realization procedure for designing a robust PI-Lead control without modeling. The developed method derives from the ultimate sensitivity principles, known in the empirical Ziegler-Nichols tuning of PID control, and makes use of some general characteristics of loop shaping. A three-steps procedure is proposed to determine the integration time constant, control gain, and Lead-element in a way to guarantee a sufficient phase margin, while all steps are served by only experimental observations of the output value. The proposed method is also evaluated with experiments on a noise-perturbed electro-mechanical actuator system with translational motion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9c81\u68d2PI-Lead\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec8\u6781\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\u548c\u73af\u8def\u6574\u5f62\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u786e\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u88d5\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u53ea\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e00\u822c\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u7c7b\u578b\u4e00\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eZiegler-Nichols PID\u6574\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec8\u6781\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73af\u8def\u6574\u5f62\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u5e38\u6570\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u548cLead\u5143\u4ef6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u673a\u7535\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5e73\u79fb\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2PI-Lead\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u6574\u5b9a\u3002"}}
